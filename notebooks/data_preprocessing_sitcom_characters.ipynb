First, you have to summarize the dialogues into context without any names of characters. Second, you have to then write a dialogue as an appropriate response to the given context, the dialogue should be in the style of Chandler Bing, one of the characters from FRIENDS. Keep in mind that Chandler Bingâ€™s humor is marked by a unique blend of sarcasm, self-deprecation, and quick wit. He tends to make jokes that deflect serious or emotional moments, often using his dry, sarcastic tone.  His style is heavily reliant on irony, often delivering punchlines that are deliberately over-the-top or nonsensical.

      "733 Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.\n",
      "735 Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)\n",

      "978 Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?

I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..

      "1047 Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.\n",
      "1051 To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)\n",
      "1056 We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.\n",
      "1060 So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!\n",
      "1062 Not a one.\n",
      "1064 Oh, right, right, shut up.\n",
      "1066 No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.\n",
      "1069 Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.\n",
      "1080 Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.\n",
      "1121 Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?\n",
      "1123 It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.\n",
      "1125 Yuh-huh.\n",
      "1127 Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearÂ—you want it to be dirty?\n",

      "1131 There you go.\n",
      "1141 Where are they? Where are they?\n",
      "1143 It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.\n",
      "1145 Here we go.\n",
      "1147 Hey, Janice.\n",
      "1149 Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?\n",
      "1151 What?\n",
      "1153 (covering) What... did you get me there?\n",
      "1155 Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.\n",

      "1213 Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.\n",
      "1245 Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.\n",
      "1247 Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?\n",
      "1249 (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.\n",
      "1251 Oh, I don't know, a million?\n",
      "1253 I'm fine.\n",
      "1255 I'm not fine. Here she comes.\n",
      "1257 How do you do that?\n",
      "1259 We should always always break up together.\n",
      "1289 I'm free! I'm free!\n",
      "1292 You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...\n",
      "1299 (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.\n",
      "1301 No, ten o'clock.\n",
      "1303 (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!\n",
      "1305 She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!\n",
      "1307 Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'\n",
      "1309 Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.\n",
      "1311 Thank you, buddy.\n",
      "1314 Y'think?\n",
      "1316 Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...\n",
      "1318 Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)\n",
      "1320 Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.\n",
      "1322 Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)\n",
      "1329 (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)\n",
      "1333 Hey, kids.\n",
      "1336 Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.\n",
      "1338 It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...\n",
      "1340 Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.\n",
      "1342 Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?\n",
      "1344 Who's Rick?\n",
      "1346 Oh, so you're divorced?\n",
      "1348 Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?\n",
      "1350 So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?\n",
      "1352 Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?\n",
      "1354 So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?\n",
      "1356 ...Hm.\n",
      "1357 What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?\n",
      "1359 Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!\n",
      "1372 Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.\n",
      "1383 Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.\n",
      "1395 Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...\n",
      "1411 Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.\n",
      "1420 Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.\n",
      "1422 C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!\n",
      "1425 Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.\n",
      "1427 Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)\n",
      "1429 No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)\n",
      "1444 God, I love these fingers...\n",
      "1446 No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.\n",
      "1448 Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)\n",
      "1450 Don't go.\n",
      "1452 (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.\n",
      "1454 Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.\n",
      "1456 What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!\n",
      "1458 I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?\n",
      "1460 Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?\n",
      "1462 Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.\n",
      "1464 You.\n",
      "1466 Nono, just you.\n",
      "1468 Lose the other guys.\n",
      "1470 C'mon, we're great together, why not?\n",
      "1472 ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'\n",
      "1474 I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...\n",
      "1476 ...The second guy.\n",
      "1478 Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.\n",
      "1484 (to Ross) \"Big guy?\"\n",
      "1491 Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.\n",
      "1508 Oh, great. This is just...\n",
      "1515 Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.\n",
      "1516 She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!\n",
      "1518 Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.\n",
      "1520 Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.\n",
      "1526 Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!\n",
      "1527 There you go!\n",
      "1528 You're definitely scaring here.\n",
      "1530 Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)\n",
      "1532 Hey, it's me.\n",
      "1534 Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.\n",
      "1536 I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!\n",
      "1538 (angry) Put Joey on the phone.\n",
      "1540 I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.\n",
      "1542 Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.\n",
      "1599 Um, is it sugarless?\n",
      "1601 Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.\n",
      "1648 You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.\n",
      "1685 (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.\n",
      "1686 Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)\n",
      "1687 Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.\n",
      "1690 (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....\n",
      "1721 OK.\n",
      "1733 Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.\n",
      "1735 Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.\n",
      "1736 Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?\n",
      "1738 Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...\n",
      "1740 Yes please.\n",
      "1742 He's a he?\n",
      "1744 ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?\n",
      "1746 You did?\n",
      "1748 Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?\n",
      "1753 You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?\n",
      "1755 Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?\n",
      "1757 Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?\n",
      "1759 WHAT IS IT?!\n",
      "1762 Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.\n",
      "1800 I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?\n",
      "1834 Hey, gorgeous.\n",
      "1836 No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.\n",
      "1838 So, uh... what do you think it is about me?\n",
      "1840 ...Quality, right, great.\n",
      "1842 Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?\n",
      "1844 Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.\n",
      "1846 No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.\n",
      "1848 Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.\n",
      "1878 Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?\n",
      "1882 Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.\n",
      "1884 You're watching a football game at a funeral?\n",
      "1886 You are a frightening, frightening man.\n",
      "1899 Oh, no-\n",
      "1901 Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.\n",
      "1908 Hey.\n",
      "1946 Who are those people?\n",
      "1954 Hey, Lowell.\n",
      "1956 So how's it going there in Financial Services?\n",
      "1958 Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.\n",
      "1960 Really.\n",
      "1962 So- you can tell?\n",
      "1964 So you don't think I have a, a quality?\n",
      "1966 He is?\n",
      "1968 Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.\n",
      "1986 Hey.\n",
      "1988 And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?\n",
      "1990 That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.\n",
      "1995 Do you know which one you're gonna be?\n",
      "1997 Good luck, man. I hope you get it.\n",
      "2005 Yes, every single one of them.\n",
      "2012 I thought it was $98.50.\n",
      "2038 I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.\n",
      "2053 All right, I'm nine years old.\n",
      "2055 We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.\n",
      "2057 Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.\n",
      "2079 Tonight, on a very special Blossom.\n",
      "2085 Oh, you must stop shooping.\n",
      "2088 No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.\n",
      "2090 Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.\n",
      "2105 The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.\n",
      "2107 No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?\n",
      "2109 Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?\n",
      "2127 Do either of you have the keys?\n",
      "2151 (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.\n",
      "2165 Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.\n",
      "2174 Now this feels like Thanksgiving.\n",
      "2181 Shall I carve?\n",
      "2183 Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?\n",
      "2191 I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",
      "2195 Here, here!\n",
      "2206 Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!\n",
      "2212 Might wanna open with the snowman.\n",
      "2221 Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!\n",
      "2224 It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.\n",
      "2226 Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.\n",
      "2240 (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!\n",
      "2258 Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.\n",
      "2260 Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.\n",
      "2263 I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.\n",
      "2265 I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\n",
      "2267 Too many jokes... must mock Joey!\n",
      "2269 Aah, y'killing me!\n",
      "2274 Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\n",
      "2276 Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\n",
      "2295 Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?\n",
      "2298 I happen to know a Fun Bob.\n",
      "2314 That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.\n",
      "2316 Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.\n",
      "2318 With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.\n",
      "2320 Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...\n",
      "2357 You remember Janice.\n",
      "2380 (Imitating) But you found me!\n",
      "2382 Kill me. Kill me now.\n",
      "2388 Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-\n",
      "2390 I'm sorry you misunderstood...\n",
      "2392 Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)\n",
      "2410 (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)\n",
      "2412 Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.\n",
      "2417 And the moment of joy is upon us.\n",
      "2421 Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)\n",
      "2427 Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!\n",
      "2458 Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?\n",
      "2464 Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.\n",
      "2467 Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?\n",
      "2469 Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'\n",
      "2471 You can say that because she's not your mom.\n",
      "2482 Shhh, busy beaming with pride.\n",
      "2484 Now why would she say that's embarrassing?\n",
      "2487 THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!\n",
      "2491 This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.\n",
      "2494 ...And then he burst into flames.\n",
      "2501 Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.\n",
      "2503 Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.\n",
      "2506 I know I am.\n",
      "2517 Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
      "2548 What are you guys doing out here?\n",
      "2553 Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)\n",
      "2586 Oh my God.\n",
      "2588 I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?\n",
      "2590 What?\n",
      "2592 (To Joey) You knew about this?\n",
      "2594 I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!\n",
      "2597 (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?\n",
      "2599 Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.\n",
      "2601 I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)\n",
      "2604 I'm still mad at you for not telling me.\n",
      "2607 You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)\n",
      "2633 What was that?\n",
      "2635 Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)\n",
      "2638 Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.\n",
      "2640 Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!\n",
      "2642 That's very funny. We done now?\n",
      "2644 That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.\n",
      "2675 No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.\n",
      "2677 You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.\n",
      "2679 Really stupid.\n",
      "2681 Yeah. No. No...\n",
      "2695 Yeah, okay.\n",
      "2697 Nice save.\n",
      "2700 Hey.\n",
      "2702 Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.\n",
      "2704 Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.\n",
      "2706 Pretty good! I told her.\n",
      "2715 No-no-no-no, we're done.\n",
      "2720 And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)\n",
      "2734 (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!\n",
      "2739 Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!\n",
      "2741 You think?\n",
      "2776 Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?\n",
      "2778 What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!\n",
      "2780 Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio\n",
      "2782 Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.\n",
      "2784 What do you mean, like, buy it together?\n",
      "2786 You think we're ready for something like that?\n",
      "2788 Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?\n",
      "2790 I'm not moving out.\n",
      "2792 Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...\n",
      "2794 It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.\n",
      "2796 Aw, don't do that\n",
      "2824 Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)\n",
      "2830 More coffee over here, please!\n",
      "2845 So what are you gonna do?\n",
      "2847 Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.\n",
      "2852 That's patio furniture!\n",
      "2854 (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?\n",
      "2856 You pick one.\n",
      "2858 Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!\n",
      "2860 Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)\n",
      "2876 So, what do you think?\n",
      "2878 I know!\n",
      "2910 What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!\n",
      "2913 My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)\n",
      "2954 Wha-\n",
      "2959 Hey!\n",
      "2966 Yeah, get out!\n",
      "2968 (to Joey) One more game?\n",
      "2971 I'm sorry!\n",
      "2973 Rachel, wait, wait.\n",
      "2975 Can I just say one thing?\n",
      "2977 That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.\n",
      "2991 Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)\n",
      "2993 Okay.\n",
      "2995 No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.\n",
      "2997 It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.\n",
      "3001 Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.\n",
      "3003 Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.\n",
      "3005 Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?\n",
      "3007 Huh.\n",
      "3009 Uhhuh, how did you know that?\n",
      "3037 (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?\n",
      "3040 Y'know, I don't see that happening?\n",
      "3042 Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'\n",
      "3047 (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.\n",
      "3050 Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.\n",
      "3073 Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.\n",
      "3078 Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?\n",
      "3080 Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.\n",
      "3089 So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?\n",
      "3104 C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \"No thanks, it's late.\"\n",
      "3112 Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?\n",

      "3120 No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I'm married.\"\n",

      "3225 I think it's winning.\n",

      "3229 No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.\n",
      "3238 Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...\n",
      "3240 Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...\n",
      "3243 Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?\n",
      "3245 Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.\n",
      "3247 ...And what did you bring?\n",
      "3249 Janice?\n",
      "3251 (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.\n",
      "3252 Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.\n",
      "3254 Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!\n",
      "3256 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!\n",
      "3277 That's OK.\n",
      "3280 (disgusted) What? What can't you do?\n",
      "3283 Tell me it's \"you and me\" we.\n",
      "3285 Ok, you can not do this to me.\n",
      "3289 I hope she throws up on you.\n",
      "3290 So...\n",
      "3292 Oh, what a crappy night!\n",
      "3294 Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?\n",
      "3296 Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?\n",
      "3298 You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?\n",
      "3300 That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...\n",
      "3303 No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.\n",
      "3308 Ok, well, this was very special.\n",
      "3311 Janice is gonna go away now.\n",
      "3315 Oh, good, Joey's home now.\n",
      "3341 How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?\n",
      "3343 Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.\n",
      "3345 Hi, Just Janice.\n",
      "3365 Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.\n",
      "3367 Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.\n",

      "3371 Oh no, you see, actually it is.\n",
      "3373 Oh, no I don't.\n",
      "3375 I did, but...\n",
      "3377 Call me!\n",
      "3412 Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.\n",
      "3414 Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.\n",
      "3416 Hey!\n",
      "3421 So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.\n",
      "3423 So.... I quit.\n",
      "3425 Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!\n",
      "3427 If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.\n",
      "3429 It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.\n",

      "3434 I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.\n",
      "3438 Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.\n",
      "3444 Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.\n",
      "3446 Can you see my nipples through this shirt?\n",
      "3449 Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the \"a-gogo.\"\n",
      "3451 Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.\n",
      "3453 Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.\n",

      "3475 And he's not speaking metaphorically.\n",
      "3489 Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) \"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.\"\n",
      "3491 Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.\n",
      "3494 Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.\n",
      "3496 (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...\n",
      "3506 You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)\n",

      "3554 (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)\n",
      "3555 Well?\n",
      "3557 Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)\n",
      "3559 Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...\n",
      "3561 (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.\n",

      "3564 Thank you Helen, that'll be all.\n",
      "3565 Last time I do that, I promise.\n",
      "3636 (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....\n",
      "3950 What are you crazy? That's a baby!\n",
      "3953 Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.\n",
      "3956 Well, only if you order stuff.\n",
      "3963 There it is! So what're you gonna do?\n",
      "3965 And your friend Phoebe?\n",

      "4348 Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?\n",
      "4360 That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.\n",

      "4637 Marcel?!\n",
      "4713 Eh. I thought that was an alp.\n",
      "4716 Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.\n",
      "4719 I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.\n",
      "4725 I feel violated. And not in a good way.\n",
      "4727 I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...\n",

      "4804 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...\n",
      "4806 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.\n",
      "4808 She answered.\n",
      "4810 I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.\n",

(Listens) Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. (Listens) Okay. (Puts down the phone.) (to Monica) She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. (He starts doing a little jig.)

      "5379 I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.\n",
      "5381 What?\n",
      "5383 Then, I don't get it.\n",
      "5385 They do?\n",
      "5387 I just wan't to...\n",
      "5389 But I just wa...\n",
      "5415 Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.\n",
      "5418 You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?\n",
      "5420 Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.\n",
      "5434 (doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.\n",
      "5442 Yeah, like in a cab...\n",
      "5444 Okay, hating this.\n",
      "5449 Here we go, here we go.\n",
      "5458 Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.\n",
      "5462 You have to pick your moments.\n",
      "5471 I used to have that bumper sticker.\n",
      "5472 (to Rachel) You see what I mean.\n",
      "5495 Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.\n",
      "5497 Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.\n",
      "5521 You'll get one.\n",
      "5523 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\n",
      "5525 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\n",
      "5527 No, no, no.\n",
      "5529 (trapped) Uh, uh.\n",
      "5531 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)\n",
      "5538 Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?\n",
      "5540 No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)\n",
      "5622 Where have you been?\n",
      "5624 Mazel tov!\n",
      "5656 (to Joey) You are really frightening me.\n",
      "5657 Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?\n",
      "5677 (to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?\n",
      "5705 I know, I still am one of these.\n",
      "5710 And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)\n",
      "5727 Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)\n",
      "5729 Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.\n",
      "5731 (sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)\n",
      "5743 (in a deep voice) Men are here.\n",
      "5745 Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.\n",
      "5755 Crazy bitch.\n",
      "5782 Hey!\n",
      "5786 Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.\n",
      "5789 Forget about her.\n",
      "5791 Course there, they just call it food.\n",
      "5796 I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.\n",
      "5799 (sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)\n",
      "5812 (pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.\n",
      "5818 Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.\n",
      "5820 Oh, that's Ross's.\n",
      "5824 Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)\n",
      "5827 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\n",
      "5829 (panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.\n",
      "5831 (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....\n",
      "5833 (rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....\n",
      "5837 No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.\n",
      "5839 OK, is there a mute button on this woman?\n",
      "5844 (quickly) H-He's in China!\n",
      "5847 What about the time difference?\n",
      "5849 Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!\n",
      "5852 Well then maybe you shouldn't go.\n",
      "5858 Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)\n",
      "5908 Hey, big...\n",
      "5910 (quietly) ...spender.\n",
      "5912 So how'd it go?\n",
      "5914 The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.\n",
      "5916 Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.\n",
      "5918 I didn't know you had another level.\n",
      "5936 Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?\n",
      "5938 Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?\n",
      "5991 No way!\n",
      "5997 Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.\n",
      "6000 Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.\n",
      "6025 Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.\n",
      "6030 Hey, Rach, can I get...\n",
      "6032 Not yet.\n",
      "6034 So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.\n",
      "6036 God?\n",
      "6038 Well, maybe it was God, doing me.\n",
      "6040 Well, you owe me one, big guy.\n",
      "6046 He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.\n",
      "6048 You have to really wanna see it.\n",
      "6062 (entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?\n",
      "6064 No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.\n",
      "6066 Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!\n",
      "6077 Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.\n",
      "6085 What stupid thing did you do?\n",
      "6096 People do stupid things when they're upset.\n",
      "6108 Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.\n",
      "6110 Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?\n",
      "6134 At least as long as I have the pants.\n",
      "6154 (entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!\n",
      "6157 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.\n",
      "6160 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...\n",
      "6162 Cupping.\n",
      "6169 Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.\n",
      "6177 That's ok.\n",
      "6201 You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)\n",
      "6204 We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?\n",
      "6209 Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?\n",
      "6214 So, uh, how often can you do it?\n",
      "6228 Hey, sweetums.\n",
      "6233 Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.\n",
      "6288 What did you just do?\n",
      "6294 What did you just do?\n",
      "6336 Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.\n",
      "6348 Howdy.\n",
      "6350 Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.\n",
      "6352 (slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.\n",
      "6354 (pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?\n",
      "6356 You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.\n",
      "6358 All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.\n",
      "7851 Hey.\n",
      "11530 Huh. (They all leave, dejected)\n",
      "11544 Morning.\n",
      "11546 Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.\n",
      "11549 Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.\n",
      "11551 I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.\n",
      "11553 Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.\n",
      "11557 Nope, not this time.\n",
      "11559 I'm not yanking you.\n",
      "11561 Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.\n",
      "11563 (looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)\n",
      "11632 Hey!\n",
      "11634 Of!\n",
      "11636 You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?\n",
      "11638 No, Janice.\n",
      "11640 You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?\n",
      "11642 Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!\n",
      "11644 Well, there you go.\n",
      "11646 Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.\n",
      "11648 I want you to say that you like her!\n",
      "11650 Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!\n",
      "11697 Umm, yeah.\n",
      "11699 Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?\n",
      "11701 We're not gonna talk about girth are we?\n",
      "11703 Yeah, okay.\n",
      "11705 Yeah! All right! You go first.\n",
      "11707 Okay.\n",
      "11709 Princess Leia in the gold bikini.\n",
      "11711 I know!\n",
      "11713 Okay.\n",
      "11715 Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.\n",
      "11717 And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....\n",
      "11719 I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!\n",
      "11721 You said...\n",
      "11725 What are you guys doing together?\n",
      "11727 Really.\n",
      "11730 You still can't stand her can you?\n",
      "11732 Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.\n",
      "11734 Well, I guess that's something.\n",
      "11736 Okay.\n",
      "11738 Oh God!\n",
      "11740 Really?\n",
      "11771 Taste it.\n",
      "11773 Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.\n",
      "11775 Hey, mister tux!\n",
      "11805 (entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.\n",
      "11807 You're in my seat.\n",
      "11809 'Cause I was sitting there.\n",
      "11811 Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.\n",
      "11813 The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.\n",
      "11816 All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!\n",
      "11832 Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.\n",
      "11834 Really!\n",
      "11844 Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.\n",
      "11848 You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey's face) Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! (Joey flings some dip onto Phoebe's dress)\n",
      "11857 Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.\n",
      "11860 All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.\n",
      "11862 All right! (jumps up)\n",
      "11864 All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)\n",
      "11889 Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.\n",
      "11897 All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, \"Get out of my chair, dillhole!\"\n",
      "11899 What are you doing?\n",
      "11901 The cushions are the essence of the chair!\n",
      "11903 Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.\n",
      "11913 We used them as pillows when we went camping.\n",
      "11915 (shyly) The sheep.\n",
      "11919 He took my essence!\n",
      "11924 Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.\n",
      "11926 What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?\n",
      "11928 He's got nothing!\n",
      "11932 What are you supporting?\n",
      "11946 Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.\n",
      "11954 (to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?\n",
      "11958 They got a phone in there, right?\n",
      "11992 Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that? (Joey enters wearing a lot of clothes)\n",
      "11994 Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!\n",
      "11996 Oooo-ooh!\n",
      "11999 Jeez, what a baby.\n",
      "12018 Stop it. Stop it! (Monica runs into the living room, and starts dialing the phone)\n",
      "12045 Excuse me. Hi.\n",
      "12047 Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.\n",
      "12049 I mean, I was sitting there.\n",
      "12051 But, I never left the room!\n",
      "12053 All right, that's it, give me your underwear.\n",
      "12056 (going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.\n",
      "12062 Hey.\n",
      "12067 Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.\n",
      "12071 Because the kids need new shoes.\n",
      "12108 Do I look fat?\n",
      "12110 Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.\n",
      "12112 Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....\n",
      "12116 Okay, so you both just know this stuff?\n",
      "12119 That's easy, baggage claim.\n",
      "12121 Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.\n",
      "12127 Thank you Rachel.\n",
      "12131 Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.\n",
      "12133 Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)\n",
      "12135 Yeah.\n",
      "12137 Okay, the old hug and roll.\n",
      "12139 Okay, one question.\n",
      "12141 You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?\n",
      "12149 Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.\n",
      "12159 Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)\n",
      "12165 Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.\n",
      "12173 That, that's what's stupid.\n",
      "12177 Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)\n",
      "12194 No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.\n",
      "12196 You mean there's more than one of us.\n",
      "12212 And that's how you bought it?\n",
      "12226 Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.\n",
      "12286 Sure. What's up?\n",
      "12296 You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!\n",
      "12299 Well, it's official there are no good movies.\n",
      "12304 Hey, man. What's up?\n",
      "12306 Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.\n",
      "12322 Is anybody else scared?\n",
      "12324 Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!\n",
      "12340 (entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.\n",
      "12342 Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.\n",
      "12344 Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.\n",
      "12346 Noo.\n",
      "12348 No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'\n",
      "12351 I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.\n",
      "12354 Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!\n",
      "12356 Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?\n",
      "12359 You think?\n",
      "12361 Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.\n",
      "12379 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)\n",
      "12381 Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.\n",
      "12383 Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.\n",
      "12385 Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.\n",
      "12387 Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!\n",
      "12389 I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.\n",
      "12391 It doesn't scare me!\n",
      "12393 Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)\n",
      "12395 So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.\n",
      "12398 Then I got all needy and clingy.\n",
      "12400 She said she'd call me.\n",
      "12402 Oh God.\n",
      "12404 This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.\n",
      "12408 So, you don't think I'm terminal?\n",
      "12410 Okay, okay. So, should I call her?\n",
      "12415 So I'm not, not gonna lose her?\n",
      "12417 I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'\n",
      "12443 (in a British accent) Hello, Janice.\n",
      "12445 (in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?\n",
      "12447 (normal voice) No. Not anymore.\n",

      "12459 Can I be that guy?\n",
      "12480 ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.\n",
      "12482 I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?\n",
      "12485 (answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?\n",
      "12489 Hello!\n",
      "12492 What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. (listens) Really?! (listens) Really?!\n",
      "12494 (on phone) I love you too.\n",

      "12541 Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?\n",
      "12543 All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.\n",
      "12545 Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one canÂ’t get mad.\n",
      "12548 Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.\n",
      "12550 I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.\n",

      "12568 Hi.\n",
      "12580 We donÂ’t, really.\n",
      "12584 You know, we donÂ’t really take advantage of living in the city.\n",
      "12587 No, you didnÂ’t get me!! ItÂ’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!\n",
      "12589 I do NOT want this unit!!\n",
      "12591 Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)\n",
      "12624 All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?\n",
      "12626 Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.\n",
      "12628 Eh, y'know what, sheÂ’s to political, she probably wouldnÂ’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.\n",
      "12630 Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know sheÂ’s too international, y'know sheÂ’s never gonna be around.\n",
      "12632 So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whoÂ’s gonna be in the country like all the time.\n",
      "12660 (entering) Have you seen Joey?\n",
      "12662 Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) YÂ’know what itÂ’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.\n",
      "12664 WhatÂ’s going on?\n",
      "12666 Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!\n",
      "12668 He started mine first!\n",

      "12743 Okay, one...two...\n",
      "12746 Oh, good job Joe.\n",
      "12748 Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!\n",
      "12752 Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how Â‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesnÂ’t move.)\n",
      "12791 Umm?\n",
      "12793 IÂ’ve got five bucks says you canÂ’t.\n",
      "12795 Oh, I think I have the cash.\n",
      "12797 Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors wonÂ’t open) IÂ’m out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.\n",
      "12825 (entering, with a goatee) Hey.\n",
      "12827 IÂ’m never gonna find a roommate, ever.\n",
      "12829 Well letÂ’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thatÂ’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!\n",
      "12831 Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who IÂ’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Â‘Chandler Bing,Â’ he said Â‘Whoa-whoa, short message.Â’\n",
      "12836 Umm, howÂ’s it going with you guys?\n",
      "12840 Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?\n",
      "12842 Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.\n",
      "12844 Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youÂ’re chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)\n",
      "12845 (running around the apartment pointing out things) Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) Bye-bye.\n",
      "12847 Sure. Ummm. WhatÂ’s up?\n",
      "12849 What gay thing?\n",
      "12851 Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.\n",

      "12864 You betcha!\n",
      "12866 Um-mm, yeah right!\n",
      "12868 Oh yes, and thatÂ’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.\n",
      "12870 Okay, but after that, weÂ’re shootinÂ’ some pool.\n",
      "12883 Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.\n",
      "12885 (picks it up) And now IÂ’ve picked it up again. (walks over to Monica.)\n",
      "12926 (leaving to go to work) Hey!\n",
      "12928 Oh, donÂ’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.\n",
      "12971 So ah, whatcha watching?\n",

      "12983 Do you have any beers? WeÂ’re out of beers.\n",
      "12985 You okay?\n",
      "12987 Right.\n",
      "12989 Noo!! You donÂ’t have a boyfriend because....I donÂ’t, I donÂ’t know why you donÂ’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.\n",
      "12991 Oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman IÂ’ve ever known in real life.\n",
      "13004 Umm, this is nice.\n",
      "13006 No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?\n",
      "13008 Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.\n",
      "13010 Oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) Oh, and listen, itÂ’s, itÂ’s gonna be....\n",
      "13037 Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross. (they shake hands)\n",
      "13039 I canÂ’t believe you came back.\n",
      "13051 If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.\n",
      "13059 (to Janice) DonÂ’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!\n",
      "13062 What a wank!\n",
      "13073 (leaning in) IÂ’ll go.\n",
      "13084 See, thatÂ’s why I could never be an actor. Because I canÂ’t say gig.\n",
      "13214 Knock, knock.\n",
      "13216 Hey, IÂ’m going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.\n",
      "13218 Okay. (to Monica) ItÂ’s a racecar.\n",
      "13220 Okay, well it this bed isnÂ’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?\n",
      "13227 You told him to play the boxer gay!!\n",
      "13229 You totally screwed him over.\n",
      "13285 Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) Hey-hey good lookinÂ’! (honks the bedÂ’s little horn on the steering wheel.) Varrrrrrrrroom. (notices Rachel and stops) All right, IÂ’ll leave. My bedÂ’s so boring.\n",
      "13287 I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)\n",
      "13288 Okay, IÂ’m not gonna have one.\n",
      "13291 All right IÂ’ll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)\n",
      "13294 See that is the problem with invisible dentists.\n",
      "13297 That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienistÂ’s blouse.\n",
      "13363 Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?\n",
      "13365 JaniceÂ’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.\n",
      "13367 ThatÂ’s a good idea, Â‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthdayÂ’. I would like to get her something serious.\n",
      "13369 All right. Look, IÂ’m gonna go in here, and you donÂ’t buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)\n",
      "13371 Why not?!\n",
      "13373 What is the thing?\n",
      "13375 (shocked) What?\n",
      "13377 Well she, she wouldnÂ’t do that, sheÂ’s with, sheÂ’s with me.\n",
      "13379 Yeah, well, youÂ’re wrong! Okay, youÂ’re wrong.\n",
      "13402 Ah, I donÂ’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.\n",
      "13404 You tell me! Maybe, itÂ’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!\n",
      "13406 All right!\n",
      "13408 Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.\n",
      "13410 No! In his office! How many kisses were there?\n",
      "13412 Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!\n",
      "13414 (giving her a bag) Here.\n",
      "13416 IÂ’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) IÂ’m gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)\n",
      "13446 Yeah.\n",
      "13448 What?\n",
      "13450 All right.\n",
      "13452 I talked to Janice.\n",
      "13454 She doesnÂ’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I canÂ’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!\n",
      "13456 I donÂ’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?\n",
      "13458 Come on, tell me.\n",
      "13460 What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?\n",
      "13481 Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because itÂ’s, itÂ’s, itÂ’s not gonna be easy.\n",
      "13483 I think you should go back with Gary. I donÂ’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Â‘YouÂ’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.Â’ and I hated that guy. And it didnÂ’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.\n",
      "13485 Yeah, well. ItÂ’s the right thing to do.\n",
      "13487 Then donÂ’t leave me!\n",
      "13489 Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!\n",
      "13491 No you donÂ’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.\n",
      "13493 Ohhh. DonÂ’t go.\n",
      "13495 No. No! No! No!\n",
      "13497 I donÂ’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I donÂ’t care!!\n",
      "13499 You canÂ’t leave! I have your shoe!\n",
      "13512 (singing) IÂ’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I canÂ’t resist your charms. And love....\n",
      "13515 (high pitched) No you know I donÂ’t mind.\n",
      "13517 I know.\n",
      "13519 IÂ’ve found.\n",
      "13534 No, no, no, I donÂ’t, I donÂ’t really wanna play.\n",
      "13536 ThatÂ’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. DonÂ’t say that I donÂ’t have goals!\n",
      "13538 Yeah, all right, IÂ’ll play.\n",
      "13547 No, no, no, you say that proudly.\n",
      "13556 And was the curse lifted?\n",
      "13562 But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wonÂ’t let me cross the street.\n",
      "13568 And then Tineals.\n",
      "13583 Wow! Just like in the pros.\n",
      "13596 The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks RossÂ’s foot instead.)\n",
      "13598 Sorry. IÂ’m sorry. Y'know what, weÂ’re just gonna throw it.\n",
      "13606 No, no, no, actually losers rhyme.\n",
      "13607 (coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between RossÂ’s legs.) Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! (Ross stands up and looks at him) You wanna go shotgun?\n",
      "13609 (from the shotgun) Hike!\n",
      "13613 Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.\n",
      "13623 No, no, no, no, no!\n",

      "14157 I canÂ’t remember which sister.\n",
      "14160 Okay! You donÂ’t think I thought of that?\n",
      "14167 (to Monica) You see you canÂ’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!\n",
      "14169 Veronica. Look, itÂ’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.\n",
      "14171 Look, when IÂ’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and IÂ’m sorry.\n",
      "14179 Why canÂ’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.\n",
      "14187 ItÂ’s gotta be the first one.\n",
      "14189 Yep, IÂ’m in a tree.\n",
      "14202 Well, thatÂ’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually IÂ’ll be in Cuba.\n",
      "14204 What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?\n",
      "14206 (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?\n",
      "14208 IÂ’m here to see Mary-Angela.\n",
      "14210 WhereÂ’s Mary-Angela?\n",
      "14245 This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?\n",
      "14247 Well, itÂ’s, itÂ’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?\n",
      "14249 So um, Mary-Angela, whatÂ’s your second favorite?\n",
      "14251 Would you just please....give me the receipt Â‘cause this is great. ItÂ’s top notch.\n",
      "14253 So will I.\n",
      "14255 Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnÂ’t mean anything.\n",
      "14257 Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)\n",
      "14258 (startled) Hey!\n",
      "14260 Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and IÂ’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.\n",
      "14262 Ahhhh, youÂ’re not Mary-Angela.\n",
      "14264 This is so bad. If-if youÂ’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?\n",
      "14266 Oh, this is soo bad. (doesnÂ’t see Mary-Angela)\n",
      "14268 No Joey! No Joey! DonÂ’t Joey! Joey!\n",
      "14270 (pats him on the shoulder) YouÂ’re it! Now run and hide!\n",
      "14273 I wasnÂ’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of JoeyÂ’s sisters gasp) Look, IÂ’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.\n",
      "14276 Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brotherÂ’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?\n",
      "14278 Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youÂ’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.\n",
      "14284 Okay, absolutely!\n",
      "14286 YouÂ’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sisterÂ’s, but he still doesnÂ’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)\n",
      "14288 What?! (Cookie punches him)\n",
      "14322 DonÂ’t worry.\n",
      "14328 Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.\n",
      "14331 All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?\n",
      "14333 I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.\n",
      "14335 Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?\n",
      "14338 (to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.\n",
      "14348 (to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?\n",
      "14350 Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.\n",
      "14352 Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.\n",
      "14354 Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.\n",
      "14356 I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.\n",
      "14362 I'll get you the Cliff Notes.\n",
      "14364 The abridgment.\n",
      "14419 ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!\n",
      "14423 Oh no, no, no, no.\n",
      "14426 All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?\n",
      "14431 Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.\n",
      "14435 To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.\n",
      "14441 Bye-bye.\n",
      "14443 What, what, what?!\n",
      "14445 You really think that is what he meant?\n",
      "14473 Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.\n",
      "14475 Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.\n",
      "14477 All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'\n",
      "14479 He paints quite a picture doesn't he?\n",
      "14528 Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?\n",
      "14530 And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked! (Rachel just stares at him.)\n",
      "14533 Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.\n",
      "14542 Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?\n",
      "14550 Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)\n",
      "14564 Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.\n",
      "14598 Yeah, baby!\n",
      "14600 Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?\n",
      "14631 Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now sheÂ’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.\n",
      "14659 Oh, hey.\n",
      "14664 (to Robert) So ah, isnÂ’t a bit cold out for shorts?\n",
      "14666 Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.\n",
      "14667 (standing up) IÂ’m up! IÂ’m up, IÂ’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?\n",
      "14671 Okay Ross, why donÂ’t you come with me?\n",
      "14673 RobertÂ’s coming out.\n",
      "14675 No. He.....heÂ’s coming out of his shorts.\n",
      "14677 The man is showing brain.\n",
      "14683 (to Ross) Wellll?\n",
      "14685 What do we do? What do we do?\n",
      "14687 Like an eclipse.\n",
      "14706 Your liking it, huh?\n",
      "14710 No, actually LaurieÂ’s a boy.\n",
      "14713 Hey.\n",
      "14716 You mean a three pointer?\n",
      "14726 IÂ’m sorry, IÂ’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isnÂ’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.\n",
      "14751 Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!\n",
      "14762 Hmmm, thatÂ’s very cool.\n",
      "14765 I canÂ’t believe she cracked your code!\n",
      "14772 No, Beth doesnÂ’t die, she doesnÂ’t die. Does she Rachel?\n",
      "14792 We canÂ’t tell him, you canÂ’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.\n",
      "14801 Yeah, we got, um-hmm.\n",
      "14846 I like her.\n",
      "14848 Well, thatÂ’s pretty much all IÂ’m looking for from these people.\n",
      "14858 (to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. IÂ’d like know whether thatÂ’s several big fish or just one big fish.\n",
      "14875 No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called Â‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.Â’\n",
      "14876 Jeez, man did you fall..(sees itÂ’s a beautiful woman coming out of the menÂ’s room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?\n",
      "14878 (to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, IÂ’m-IÂ’m talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.\n",
      "14880 Ginger. IÂ’m talking to Ginger, so....\n",
      "14882 Nope, nope, IÂ’d just ah, IÂ’d rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)\n",
      "14934 Well, thatÂ’s the best kiss IÂ’ve had with anyone IÂ’ve ever met in a menÂ’s room.\n",
      "14936 (sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.\n",
      "14938 Yeah, weÂ’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.\n",
      "14940 No, really youÂ’re gonna freeze.\n",
      "14942 YouÂ’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?\n",
      "14989 Hey.\n",
      "14991 Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.\n",
      "14993 Great. It was great. SheÂ’s ah, sheÂ’s great, great looking, great personality, sheÂ’s greatness.\n",
      "14995 Joey told you about the leg, huh?\n",
      "14997 Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnÂ’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I donÂ’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often itÂ’s like Â‘Hey, y'know what, whereÂ’s your leg?Â’ I mean IÂ’m the smallest person in the world arenÂ’t I? IÂ’m the smallest person in the world.\n",
      "14999 (to Monica) Actually heÂ’s the smallest person in the world.\n",
      "15001 It came up.\n",
      "15019 No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?\n",
      "15021 No. No. I donÂ’t think so.\n",
      "15024 ThatÂ’s-thatÂ’s my nubbin.\n",
      "15026 ItÂ’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.\n",
      "15028 Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?\n",
      "15030 You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?\n",
      "15046 (entering, happily) Well hello!\n",
      "15048 The doctor.\n",
      "15050 Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.\n",
      "15054 That was an obvious joke, and I didnÂ’t think of it. Why didnÂ’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!\n",
      "15077 (entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? IÂ’m going down to the Xerox place.\n",
      "15079 Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.\n",
      "15082 Yeah! You wanna come?\n",
      "15084 Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!\n",
      "15086 Uh-oh.\n",
      "15089 (to Joey) Okay, that hurt us.\n",
      "15091 Well ah, ........y'know.\n",
      "15098 All right, rock on. (Does the Â‘Hang 10Â’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)\n",
      "15132 Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?\n",
      "15134 What time is it now?\n",
      "15136 Yeah all right, so weÂ’ll hang out.\n",
      "15138 Yes. Vividly.\n",
      "15140 Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...\n",
      "15142 Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?\n",
      "15144 She was kidding.\n",
      "15146 She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.\n",
      "15148 Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)\n",
      "15150 Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.\n",
      "15152 Well it you donÂ’t know that, then I donÂ’t want to do this with you.\n",
      "15211 And thatÂ’s the only colour that comes in.\n",
      "15214 So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.\n",
      "15251 Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.\n",
      "15253 Hey, this isnÂ’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!\n",
      "15254 Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.\n",
      "15256 Why? What happened to him?\n",
      "15387 Oh my God! Oh my God!\n",
      "15390 Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?\n",
      "15393 HeÂ’s right. NobodyÂ’s gonna benefit, and youÂ’re just gonna hurt her.\n",
      "15396 All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timingÂ’s right. And thatÂ’s what deathbeds are for.\n",
      "15402 Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. IssacÂ’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And PhoebeÂ’s friends with Rachel. And thatÂ’s the trail, I did it!\n",
      "15465 Off?!!\n",
      "15467 Yeah, well I donÂ’t think you can make that statement, unless youÂ’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.\n",
      "15470 Oh, thatÂ’s mature.\n",
      "15477 Nothing, nothing.\n",
      "15488 Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....\n",
      "15490 (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.\n",
      "15496 Uh-oh.\n",
      "15503 She was not good. Not good.\n",
      "15507 Uh-oh.\n",
      "15512 Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.\n",
      "15530 Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.\n",
      "15533 (handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, weÂ’re never leaving, ever.\n",
      "15548 Oh great, food with hair on it.\n",
      "15550 Because that would be crazy?\n",
      "15560 Yeah, come on, itÂ’s Ross and Rachel, theyÂ’ve got too.\n",
      "15563 What?\n",
      "15565 Are you actually saying these words?\n",
      "15588 LetÂ’s go.\n",
      "15589 (to Joey) Is that your new walk?\n",
      "15592 This is the New York Times.\n",
      "15595 We are. HeÂ’s meeting us here.\n",
      "15601 Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.\n",
      "15606 Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnÂ’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.\n",
      "15611 Y'know what maybe itÂ’s gonna be okay, I mean itÂ’s been a week.\n",
      "15625 No.\n",
      "15629 Yes, yes, itÂ’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.\n",
      "15633 Yeah, heÂ’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.\n",
      "15646 (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!\n",
      "15648 Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, IÂ’m, IÂ’m smoking still.\n",
      "15650 Look, IÂ’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.\n",
      "15652 Yeahhh. IÂ’m tellinÂ’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....\n",
      "15653 Oh thatÂ’s great, with my luck, thatÂ’s gonna be him.\n",
      "15655 Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and itÂ’s Rachel again.)\n",
      "15659 Hey, shut up!! YouÂ’re not my real Mom!!\n",
      "15663 Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.\n",
      "15679 Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.\n",
      "15682 (to Joey) Well heÂ’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.\n",
      "15685 What?\n",
      "15687 Beam me up Jesus.\n",
      "15689 Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.\n",
      "15693 Oh, come on, thereÂ’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.\n",
      "15695 Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.\n",
      "15704 Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!\n",
      "15706 (to Joey) My lighterÂ’s in there! (points to the cab)\n",
      "15707 Damn! (stands up) The tailpipeÂ’s not hot enough to light this!\n",
      "15709 Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.\n",
      "15724 Ladies, ladies, letÂ’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off MonicaÂ’s bra.\n",
      "15727 Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.\n",
      "15730 Okay, now letÂ’s decide who has the nicest ass.\n",
      "15734 At least let me smoke it to the good part.\n",
      "15777 I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)\n",
      "15779 Well itÂ’s very unsettling.\n",
      "15815 Oh no, now itÂ’s not gonna make any sense!\n",
      "15817 Oh, this is horrible, itÂ’s just horrible.\n",
      "15825 ItÂ’s horrible.\n",
      "15831 Y'know what, I can handle it, handleÂ’s my middle name. Actually itÂ’s the ah, middle part of my first name.\n",
      "15851 Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)\n",
      "15870 I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.\n",
      "15890 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.\n",
      "15892 Okay.\n",
      "15894 No-no, why donÂ’t you hang on to that one.\n",
      "15895 Okay, thatÂ’s like the least fun game ever.\n",
      "15897 Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)\n",
      "15906 Or what my Father called Thursday night.\n",
      "15930 Y'know, I wouldÂ’ve bet good money that heÂ’d be the first one of us to get married.\n",
      "15936 Always illegal Joe.\n",
      "15945 If that doesnÂ’t keep kids in school, what will?\n",
      "15985 (entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.\n",
      "15987 Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?\n",
      "15990 Y'know what, pretty good.\n",
      "15992 Good! I havenÂ’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.\n",
      "15995 Thanks\n",
      "15997 What check thing?\n",
      "15999 (reading the check) Pete Becker. PeteÂ…",
      " (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?\n",
      "16001 WhoÂ’s he hugginÂ’?\n",
      "16003 This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!\n",
      "16005 There you go!!\n",
      "16011 (to the girls who are staring at him) What?\n",
      "16090 (in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)\n",
      "16092 Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.\n",
      "16094 Okay, then get the lobster!\n",
      "16145 Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.\n",
      "16149 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?\n",
      "16151 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?\n",
      "16155 Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.\n",
      "16189 ItÂ’s possible. You are very loveable, IÂ’d miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.\n",
      "16191 (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, IÂ’d miss you.\n",
      "16228 And youÂ’re our age. YouÂ’re our age.\n",
      "16233 ThatÂ’s not a state Joe.\n",
      "16237 YouÂ’re our age!\n",
      "16253 I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnÂ’t matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. ItÂ’s so annoying. Does it bug you?\n",
      "16255 Is there any chance you didnÂ’t see that?\n",
      "16256 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You canÂ’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! YouÂ’re gonna get peep eye!\n",
      "16258 You didnÂ’t just break up.\n",
      "16260 You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!\n",
      "16262 Okay.\n",
      "16264 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.\n",
      "16266 Stop what?!\n",
      "16268 No!! You canÂ’t!!\n",
      "16270 I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!\n",
      "16272 Look man!\n",
      "16274 Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)\n",
      "16276 SheÂ’s moving on! Okay, if itÂ’s not this guy, itÂ’s gonna be somebody else! And unless youÂ’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? ItÂ’s over.\n",
      "16278 Okay.\n",
      "16280 I know. (He rubs RossÂ’s head)\n",
      "16313 I donÂ’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)\n",
      "16314 (to Joey) I wasnÂ’t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?\n",
      "16316 Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.\n",
      "16318 I think somebody has a crush on somebody.\n",
      "16320 IÂ’m talking about you. You big, big freak.\n",
      "16322 Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youÂ’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!\n",
      "16346 Â‘Cause itÂ’s-itÂ’s not his last name.\n",
      "16348 No, itÂ’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. HeÂ’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but thereÂ’s no Gold Man.\n",
      "16357 So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?\n",
      "16359 What about things that are already gold?\n",
      "16361 Okay, letÂ’s play my game now.\n",
      "16363 Wait a minute, wait. YouÂ’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnÂ’t want you back?!\n",
      "16384 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.\n",
      "16387 Hey.\n",
      "16390 Oh, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)\n",
      "16392 Yes, I realise that.\n",
      "16394 ThatÂ’s the stuff! (quickly grabs it)\n",
      "16398 Thanks, itÂ’s ah, Gaelic, for Â‘Thy turkeyÂ’s done.Â’ So ah, IÂ’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.\n",
      "16412 Hello.\n",
      "16422 (holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?\n",
      "16434 Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.\n",
      "16436 Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? CheckinÂ’ out the Chan-Chan man!\n",
      "16438 Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. IÂ’ll do it.\n",
      "16485 (entering) Hey, my FatherÂ’s house does that!\n",
      "16487 Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and thereÂ’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.\n",
      "16489 Of course, I didnÂ’t get to enjoy any of that, because JoannaÂ’s such a big, dull dud!\n",
      "16550 (entering with Rachel) IÂ’m telling ya, JoannaÂ’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, Â‘This was fun. LetÂ’s do it again sometime. IÂ’ll give you a call.Â’\n",
      "16552 ThatÂ’s what you say at the end of a date.\n",
      "16554 To her face? Look itÂ’s the end of the date, IÂ’m standing there, I know all sheÂ’s waiting for is for me to say Â‘IÂ’ll call herÂ’ and itÂ’s just y'know, comes out. I canÂ’t help it, itÂ’s a compulsion.\n",
      "16570 Multiple, so many paper cuts.\n",
      "16572 (sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.\n",
      "16574 Look, you canÂ’t call somebody after this long just to say, Â‘In case you didnÂ’t notice, I donÂ’t like you!Â’\n",
      "16576 Nooo!! SheÂ’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!\n",
      "16578 All right! Fine! But itÂ’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I donÂ’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!\n",
      "16580 ThatÂ’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.\n",
      "16610 ItÂ’s not a big deal. ItÂ’s, just itÂ’s right here, (points to his eye) and itÂ’s all the time.\n",
      "16612 (He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.\n",
      "16614 The food there was, was great.\n",
      "16616 So take care.\n",
      "16618 Well, this was great. IÂ’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)\n",
      "16622 Noo!\n",
      "16624 Look, IÂ’m sorry. Okay? IÂ’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.\n",
      "16626 AhhhhÂ—IÂ’m not going to call you.\n",
      "16628 IÂ’m sorry. IÂ’m-IÂ’m-IÂ’m sorry that I said I was going to when IÂ’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnÂ’t RachelÂ’s fault. ItÂ’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. And IÂ’m really sorry, itÂ’s just that this is not, this isnÂ’t going to work out.\n",
      "16630 Yeah, o-okay.\n",
      "16632 Well this is great! IÂ’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!\n",
      "16643 (sporting a goatee) Hey.\n",
      "16645 Oh, so thatÂ’s why the priest threw holy water on me. (thereÂ’s no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.\n",
      "16648 Hey.\n",
      "16650 No way!\n",
      "16652 Oh my God! WhoÂ’s gonna watch that?!\n",
      "16654 Yeah. (they start to leave)\n",
      "16656 Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)\n",
      "16698 So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.\n",
      "16700 Okay, so I guess thatÂ’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.\n",
      "16702 Hey!\n",
      "16704 Okay. (He opens it and itÂ’s a baby chick) ItÂ’s a chicken.\n",
      "16707 Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.\n",
      "16710 Easy Lenny.\n",
      "16738 Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.\n",
      "16740 Hey.\n",
      "16742 She?\n",
      "16744 I donÂ’t know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I canÂ’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.\n",
      "16746 Excuse me?\n",
      "16748 I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!\n",
      "16750 You donÂ’t think I get up when you get up?\n",
      "16752 Yes, here it comes! IÂ’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I donÂ’t think so mister!\n",
      "16754 And you donÂ’t think taking care of our chick is work?\n",
      "16756 I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick, weÂ’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?\n",
      "16758 IÂ’ll take her back tomorrow.\n",
      "16761 Hey!\n",
      "16785 (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!\n",
      "16897 I know. See, yes. ThatÂ’s Yasmine Bleeth, sheÂ’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.\n",
      "16899 Hey!\n",
      "16901 I did! But the store wouldnÂ’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?\n",
      "16902 If they canÂ’t find a home for her, they kill her! And IÂ’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!\n",
      "16904 Okay. And itÂ’s not just chicks y'know? ItÂ’s all kinds of other animals!\n",
      "16906 Thanks, IÂ’m glad you see it that way.\n",
      "16907 Ohhh-hoo, funny story!\n",
      "16932 Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!\n",
      "16934 ThatÂ’s a bad duck!!! (to Ross) HowÂ’d the thing go tonight, Ross?\n",
      "16938 (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)\n",
      "16955 (coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?\n",
      "16957 Having a swim.\n",
      "16959 Chicks donÂ’t swim.\n",
      "16961 I donÂ’t know. Should we try it?\n",
      "16963 See, I told you they donÂ’t swim. (He goes to take it out)\n",
      "16965 Noo! (takes him out) Oh, itÂ’s okay, itÂ’s okay, baby, baby, baby.\n",
      "16972 Ye-e-es!!\n",
      "16981 WhoÂ’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.\n",
      "16992 Bye!\n",
      "16999 Yeah, and I donÂ’t have any cologne.\n",
      "17001 Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.\n",
      "17015 (entering, carrying the chick and duck) Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?\n",
      "17018 Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.\n",
      "17054 (seeing Joey) There he is!\n",
      "17057 Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.\n",
      "17059 I know.\n",
      "17063 So thatÂ’s the girl you like.\n",
      "17066 Wait a minute, wait a minute, you donÂ’t like the guy RachelÂ’s dating? Well, thatÂ’s odd.\n",
      "17081 Could I borrow it?\n",
      "17151 Oh-ho-ho-ho.\n",
      "17156 7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesnÂ’t work.\n",
      "17163 Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!\n",
      "17166 Ross, donÂ’t. Ross!\n",
      "17184 Ohh, thatÂ’s a good one.\n",
      "17199 Why donÂ’t you use ours across the hall, Â‘cause sheÂ…",
      "hasÂ…",
      "problems.\n",
      "17209 Step away from the duck.\n",
      "17235 And yet, sheÂ’s still not hanging up the phone.\n",
      "17242 Or... Dick.\n",
      "17246 Was it like a sneeze only better?\n",
      "17251 No!!\n",
      "17253 Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.\n",
      "17257 No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a\n",
      "17259 Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.\n",
      "17266 Hey!\n",
      "17271 Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.\n",
      "17273 You're right, I know.\n",
      "17286 (joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?\n",
      "17290 Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.\n",
      "17323 Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.\n",
      "17335 Well sensitive is important, pick him.\n",
      "17347 (sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.\n",
      "17372 So, what do you thing the good news is?\n",
      "17381 Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? HeÂ’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thatÂ’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.\n",
      "17386 Oh, so youÂ’re going with the teacher, huh?\n",
      "17489 (comforting the duck) EverythingÂ’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?\n",
      "17494 Do you think that thereÂ’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as youÂ’re driving into town thereÂ’s-thereÂ’s like a sign, and it says Â“YouÂ’re in Sample.Â” (He says it like urine sample.)\n",
      "17543 Yeah, itÂ’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Â“TheyÂ’re are no rules.Â”\n",
      "17550 Yes, but thereÂ’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.\n",
      "17552 Oh itÂ’s Bing, sir. IÂ’m sorry , I was just ah...\n",
      "17556 All right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)\n",
      "17558 Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.\n",
      "17560 Well, I didnÂ’t do anything. I didnÂ’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.\n",
      "17564 Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between Â‘em.\n",
      "17570 (to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?\n",
      "17616 (to his co-workers) What is with him?\n",
      "17619 Well, thatÂ’s not true, he-he smacked you once.\n",
      "17623 No sir.\n",
      "17664 (joining them) Hey! Which oneÂ’s my turkey burger?\n",
      "17668 Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, itÂ’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow IÂ’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.\n",
      "17670 Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!\n",
      "17672 No, I ah, I didnÂ’t do them.\n",
      "17674 No, no I just ah, didnÂ’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly donÂ’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.\n",
      "17676 Doug!!\n",
      "17678 IÂ’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.\n",
      "17680 No, no. It-itÂ’s not about the swearing, itÂ’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.\n",
      "17682 Oh, and donÂ’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. ItÂ’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, itÂ’s making all the other guys jealous.\n",
      "17684 Okay. (he starts to leave)\n",
      "17686 Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)\n",
      "17723 Thank you, sir.\n",
      "17726 No. No, not at all, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s ridiculous.\n",
      "17728 Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!\n",
      "17731 Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!\n",
      "17742 (to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!\n",
      "17744 Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.\n",
      "17750 (reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.\n",
      "17764 YouÂ’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.\n",
      "17766 Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, IÂ’ll be your boyfriend.\n",
      "17768 Why is that so funny?\n",
      "17770 Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?\n",
      "17772 Okay, so weÂ’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werenÂ’t friends, say itÂ’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and IÂ’m like (in a fake voice) Â“Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.Â”\n",
      "17783 Hey!\n",
      "17785 What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I canÂ’t have children!!\n",
      "17790 Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?\n",
      "17840 Big bullies!!\n",
      "17843 Hey!\n",
      "17846 Bored and bored!\n",
      "17863 Yes!\n",
      "17869 Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.\n",
      "17902 So, you still donÂ’t think IÂ’m boyfriend material?\n",
      "17904 I saw you checking me out during the game last night.\n",
      "17906 Yeah, well, lucky for you.\n",
      "17908 I donÂ’t know.\n",
      "17913 Oh, yeah, I donÂ’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.\n",
      "17947 Where ya going?\n",
      "17988 (to Joey) Noo!! I donÂ’t care! IÂ’m not, IÂ’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!\n",
      "18010 Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You donÂ’t need that kindÂ’ve hurt. Take it from a guy whoÂ’s never had a long term relationship......\n",
      "18013 Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)\n",
      "18015 Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.\n",
      "18020 There is not one hair on that head.\n",
      "18026 (in a fake voice) Hi there.\n",
      "18028 Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youÂ’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!\n",
      "18029 Hi! IÂ’m Dorf! YouÂ’re date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thatÂ’s good stuff!!\n",
      "18034 (to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)\n",
      "18077 (jumping up) Oh, IÂ’ll go out and get you some.\n",
      "18079 Nope! Because IÂ’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, whoÂ’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?\n",
      "18081 I found a dried up seashores.\n",
      "18111 All right, thereÂ’s a nuclear holocaust, IÂ’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?\n",
      "18113 IÂ’ve got canned goods.\n",
      "18115 Excellent hole, Joe.\n",
      "18120 Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!\n",
      "18124 WeÂ’ve got to do something!\n",
      "18130 Y'know what, heÂ’s right. ThereÂ’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.\n",
      "18139 Me too!!\n",
      "18146 Oh my God! If you say that one more time, IÂ’m gonna break up with you!\n",
      "18149 Look, Ross, you have what you want, youÂ’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youÂ’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.\n",
      "18172 (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!\n",
      "18174 IÂ’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.\n",
      "18183 (running over and joining Monica) TheyÂ’ll never understand!\n",
      "18186 (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnÂ’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on MonicaÂ’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)\n",
      "18189 And then Joey remembered something.\n",
      "18196 (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Â“Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!Â” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.\n",
      "18227 (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?\n",
      "18243 I KNEW IT!!!!\n",
      "18245 We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.\n",
      "18247 Okay. All right.\n",

      "18251 You donÂ’t turn and slide, you throw it out! IÂ’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!\n",
      "18253 All right, how about we, how Â‘bout we sell it.\n",

      "18350 Y'know, I, I really donÂ’t think we need a canoe.\n",
      "18352 All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!\n",
      "18367 Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times heÂ’s wrong.\n",
      "18369 Oh-no, heÂ’s right.\n",
      "18382 IÂ’m coming already!!\n",
      "18414 OH MY GOD!!!\n",
      "18416 Are you all right?!\n",
      "18418 (lets him out) What happened?!!\n",
      "18420 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!\n",
      "18422 SoÂ—You got in voluntarily?!\n",
      "18424 BEND OVER?!!!\n",
      "18438 Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!\n",
      "18448 Oh, they said uh, Â“You donÂ’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.Â”\n",
      "18469 Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, weÂ’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)\n",
      "18476 Oh no-no-no, IÂ’m, IÂ’m paddling away!\n",
      "18478 Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!\n",
      "18480 Could we be more white trash?\n",
      "18490 Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.\n",
      "18492 Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.\n",
      "18494 (laughs) No. No!\n",
      "18496 Well, not at first.\n",
      "18499 Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.\n",
      "18501 Oh, come on! ItÂ’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually IÂ’m pretty much just in there by myself.\n",
      "18503 Okay, I promise, IÂ’ll end it.\n",
      "18505 I hope you know what IÂ’m giving up for ya, because sheÂ’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "18529 it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)\n",
      "18559 It just doesnÂ’tÂ…",
      "feel like weÂ’re breaking up.\n",
      "18561 Okay.\n",
      "18563 Thanks.\n",
      "18565 Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)\n",
      "18567 IÂ’m getting dressed.\n",
      "18569 When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.\n",
      "18571 What is it?\n",
      "18573 Ah-ha, youÂ’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.\n",
      "18575 You are, youÂ’re gonna leave me like this?\n",
      "18577 Okay. But if you donÂ’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) thereÂ’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!\n",
      "18585 Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?\n",
      "18586 Hello, JoannaÂ…",
      "(Realises he doesnÂ’t know her last name)Â…",
      "Â’s office.\n",
      "18588 How little?!\n",
      "18590 Look, this isnÂ’t funny! You get back here right now!\n",
      "18592 Why not?!\n",
      "18594 What?!\n",
      "18597 (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?\n",
      "18598 Okay, hereÂ’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.\n",
      "18600 I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!\n",
      "18602 It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.\n",
      "18604 No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I canÂ’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and IÂ’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind JoannaÂ’s desk.)\n",
      "18606 Never!\n",
      "18608 Fine!\n",
      "18610 IÂ—never borrowed your Walkman.\n",
      "18612 You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)\n",
      "18614 No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!\n",
      "18616 About what?\n",
      "18618 IÂ’ll make something up! IÂ’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!\n",
      "18620 Oh-ho-ho, I donÂ’t think so!\n",
      "18621 Well, this is much better.\n",
      "18645 Hey, look, youÂ’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, sheÂ’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.\n",
      "18647 It still wouldnÂ’t be clean. (Rachel makes an Â‘Eww, disgusting!Â’ face) All I want is my freedom.\n",
      "18649 Freedom!\n",
      "18651 Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wonÂ’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)\n",
      "18654 IÂ’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please justÂ…",
      " (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)\n",
      "18667 No!\n",
      "18669 With extra pulp?\n",
      "18671 No!\n",
      "18673 You donÂ’t have it.\n",
      "18675 How do Monica and Phoebe know?\n",
      "18677 (intrigued) Go on.\n",
      "18679 And Milton Berle has a\n",
      "18698 (hello) Hello.\n",
      "18701 (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)\n",
      "18705 (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!\n",
      "18707 I think so.\n",
      "18719 Could there be more Kims?\n",
      "18729 Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnÂ’t say Â‘coolÂ’ anymore.\n",
      "18758 Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but IÂ’ve missed the last 1200 times.\n",
      "18760 You donÂ’t think IÂ’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.\n",
      "18762 Oh Maria. You canÂ’t say no to her, sheÂ’s like this lycra spandex covered gymÂ…",
      "treat.\n",
      "18764 No!\n",
      "18766 Oh no, youÂ’ll have to come.\n",
      "18782 Why donÂ’t you just give him to somebody else?\n",
      "18786 Because thatÂ’s the only part of you he can see when heÂ’s on the table!\n",
      "18805 Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!\n",
      "18807 No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!\n",
      "18809 Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "18811 I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "18813 (He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Â‘Be strongÂ’ sound.) I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "18817 (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "18853 Hey.\n",
      "18855 No, I almost did, couldnÂ’t leave Ross there without a spotter!\n",
      "18859 WeÂ’re doomed. Okay, theyÂ’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?\n",
      "18862 YouÂ’re a genius!\n",
      "18864 Now, thereÂ’s two reasons.\n",
      "18874 Thank you, Joey.\n",
      "18904 Hi.\n",
      "18908 No, weÂ’d just like to close them.\n",
      "18911 I wanna quit the bank!\n",
      "18933 To pay for the gym.\n",
      "18934 Hey.\n",
      "18943 YeahÂ…",
      " Bunny-rabbit.\n",
      "18976 Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.\n",
      "18978 I could die.\n",
      "18981 I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.\n",
      "18983 Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)\n",
      "18986 All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?\n",
      "18988 (gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.\n",
      "18990 Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?\n",
      "18992 Uh Kathy, with K or a C?\n",
      "18994 Oh-oh-hey!\n",
      "18996 Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.\n",
      "18999 Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)\n",
      "19001 Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.\n",
      "19004 (sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!\n",
      "19006 Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.\n",
      "19008 Oh my God! That's why I got up too!\n",
      "19010 Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...\n",
      "19012 So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.\n",
      "19014 That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.\n",
      "19016 Is it on?\n",
      "19018 Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)\n",
      "19020 Oh! It's on! It's on!\n",
      "19021 There we go little fella.\n",
      "19023 Well the duck can swim.\n",
      "19036 Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.\n",
      "19038 She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?\n",
      "19040 No, I don't.\n",
      "19043 Thank you, Ross.\n",
      "19045 All right.\n",
      "19047 All right.\n",
      "19095 Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) Kathy! (He keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) Fetch! Fetch it! (He frees himself and resumes the chase) Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! (He now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. He gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) Kathy! (He jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) Kathy.\n",
      "19097 Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"\n",
      "19099 Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)\n",
      "19105 (entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.\n",
      "19109 I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get one) No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!\n",
      "19114 Really?!\n",
      "19116 (laughs) Right in there!\n",
      "19117 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.\n",
      "19119 Hey!\n",
      "19121 Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.\n",
      "19123 Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.\n",
      "19125 You-you do?\n",
      "19127 You got me.\n",
      "19129 Yeah. Right.\n",
      "19131 Okay.\n",
      "19154 Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.\n",
      "19156 Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.\n",
      "19158 Uhh, no-no thanks.\n",
      "19160 Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)\n",
      "19162 What?\n",
      "19164 Hey, look, what do you want from me?\n",
      "19166 I am pretending.\n",
      "19168 Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!\n",
      "19193 Can I sleep on your couch?\n",
      "19208 Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.\n",
      "19212 Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?\n",
      "19215 Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.\n",
      "19219 Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?\n",
      "19221 Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.\n",
      "19223 Well, I have a call in about that.\n",
      "19225 Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.\n",
      "19227 Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.\n",
      "19229 Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.\n",
      "19232 It doesn't say that. Does it?\n",
      "19234 Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.\n",
      "19255 It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?\n",
      "19296 (confused) Sure...\n",
      "19298 I don't know... um, Grease?\n",
      "19300 Rent?\n",
      "19302 Okay, so when do you want to go?\n",
      "19305 Yes, it is, at Office Max.\n",
      "19307 A pen.\n",
      "19309 Huh-huh! You can't give her that.\n",
      "19311 Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!\n",
      "19314 All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?\n",
      "19316 For three years?\n",
      "19318 All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?\n",
      "19320 Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?\n",
      "19352 Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.\n",
      "19354 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things for Kathy.\" (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?\n",
      "19356 She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.\n",
      "19358 Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?\n",
      "19361 Where?\n",
      "19363 I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!\n",
      "19365 No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?\n",
      "19367 No, it came out to an even twenty.\n",
      "19406 Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?\n",
      "19408 Oh yeah? That's great!\n",
      "19410 [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh.... [Kathy enters]\n",
      "19413 Hey! Happy birthday.\n",
      "19416 No he didn't. [Moving it back.\n",
      "19418 Happy birthday! I'm sorry.\n",
      "19420 See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.\n",
      "19422 Oh, yeah... yeah.\n",
      "19426 [to Kathy] Goodnight.\n",
      "19428 Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.\n",
      "19430 Uh, the book?\n",
      "19432 What do you mean?\n",
      "19434 (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, \"Uhl, ell.\"\n",
      "19436 Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.\n",
      "19438 Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)\n",
      "19444 (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!\n",
      "19446 It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean itÂ’s bad enough that IÂ’m in love with my roommates girlfriendÂ—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time weÂ’re in the room together thereÂ’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when IÂ’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, sheÂ’s smooth! Smooth! (leaves)\n",
      "19452 (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?\n",
      "19454 GoinÂ’ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didnÂ’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.\n",
      "19456 (shocked) What?\n",
      "19458 Wait! YouÂ’re going out with Kathy!\n",
      "19460 Well, IÂ’m upsetÂ—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He canÂ’t believe he just sad that.)\n",
      "19462 Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that sheÂ’s-sheÂ’s smart, and funny, and gets you.\n",
      "19464 All right look, I think itÂ’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.\n",
      "19481 All right! Bring it on, you\n",
      "19483 (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!\n",
      "19485 Really, bitchinÂ’!\n",
      "19493 You mean like, music?\n",
      "19494 Yeah, I know what youÂ’re thinkinÂ’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.\n",
      "19495 Come in!\n",
      "19497 Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.\n",
      "19499 No-no, heÂ’s not back yet, but heÂ’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?\n",
      "19501 I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) Â…",
      "of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.\n",
      "19503 What happened?\n",
      "19505 Why canÂ’t you tell her?\n",
      "19507 Joey! Joey!!\n",
      "19509 I thought your time ran out.\n",
      "19511 (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. HeÂ’s running a little late, he says heÂ’s sorry.\n",
      "19513 So I guess itÂ’s just uh, you and me then.\n",
      "19515 Yeah, I think it is!\n",
      "19517 Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut\n",
      "19519 and then it got canceled.\n",
      "19521 Really?! You do that?\n",
      "19523 Dog grooming huh? Okay, just donÂ’t make my tail too poofy.\n",
      "19525 Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) YÂ’know who also has great hair is Joey!\n",
      "19527 What-what Â‘cha doinÂ’?\n",
      "19529 Â‘Kay.\n",
      "19531 (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phoneÂ’s making sounds! (On phone) Hello!\n",
      "19533 Hey itÂ’s Joey!\n",
      "19535 What?\n",
      "19537 Okay.\n",
      "19539 Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)\n",
      "19541 Yeah. Yes! Yeah.\n",
      "19543 Oh.\n",
      "19545 No-no-no-no, this is bad! ItÂ’s bad! This is bad!\n",
      "19547 Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?\n",
      "19549 Okay!\n",
      "19551 Ooh! Yes! Okay! HereÂ’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.\n",
      "19553 Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means weÂ’re unhappy forever. Sound good?\n",
      "19555 I have to; heÂ’s my best friend, and youÂ’re seeing him.\n",
      "19557 (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! DonÂ’t! DonÂ’t! See-see, youÂ’re getting me confused, IÂ’m starting to urn.\n",
      "19559 I-I think we have too.\n",
      "19561 Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?\n",
      "19578 Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)\n",
      "19580 I sure did.\n",
      "19582 Well, I just thought itÂ’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.\n",
      "19584 Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)\n",
      "19586 Well, yÂ’know IÂ’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.\n",
      "19588 Oh, I donÂ’t know.\n",
      "19590 You mean with Casey.\n",
      "19592 Or Casey.\n",
      "19594 Could be Casey.\n",
      "19596 Consider Casey.\n",
      "19598 That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!\n",
      "19610 I kissed Kathy.\n",
      "19614 No. Is there anyway, anyway you think heÂ’ll understand this?\n",
      "19617 Oh, donÂ’t say that! DonÂ’t say that. ThatÂ’s not true. Is it?\n",
      "19620 Then why didnÂ’t you tell me to do that?!!\n",
      "19625 God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!\n",
      "19627 Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!\n",
      "19629 Yeah, I know.\n",
      "19631 Hey!\n",
      "19633 Is that a real thing?\n",
      "19635 Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.\n",
      "19637 ItÂ’s-itÂ’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.\n",
      "19639 Yeah.\n",
      "19641 What?\n",
      "19643 Oh uh, when?\n",
      "19645 Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?\n",
      "19647 Yes, but I-I uh, donÂ’t have too.\n",
      "19649 Yeah?\n",
      "19651 Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.\n",
      "19653 See uh, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.\n",
      "19655 ItÂ’s me. IÂ’m the other guy.\n",
      "19657 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and\n",
      "19659 No! No! No! I just kissed her.\n",
      "19661 How is that worse?!\n",
      "19663 Look, IÂ’m sorry! But thereÂ’s nothing I can do, I think IÂ’m in love with her!\n",
      "19665 YouÂ’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.\n",
      "19667 Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!\n",
      "19669 Probably because\n",
      "19682 (on phone) Hey, itÂ’s me. I know you canÂ’t stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought IÂ’d try and apologize over the phone. All IÂ…",
      " (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)\n",
      "19684 Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but IÂ’mÂ…",
      " (Joey hangs up the phone again.)\n",
      "19689 (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!\n",
      "19692 They couldnÂ’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.\n",
      "19701 Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, Â‘cause I wanna trade for her.\n",
      "19703 Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?\n",
      "19705 Oh thatÂ’s not true! ThatÂ’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with itÂ…",
      " (notices the look on Monica and PhoebeÂ’s faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on itÂ…",
      " (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials\n",
      "19708 Op, y'know what though, itÂ’s kindÂ’ve a girlie briefcase.\n",
      "19710 Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!\n",
      "19712 Thanks.\n",
      "19717 Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.\n",
      "19720 Well maybe you should put some ice on it.\n",
      "19724 HeÂ’s really picky about his patients.\n",
      "19733 (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.\n",
      "19736 Oh yÂ’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.\n",
      "19738 I donÂ’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.\n",
      "19740 Oh no-no-no, you donÂ’t want to do that, then youÂ’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.\n",
      "19742 Like?\n",
      "19744 When was the last time you saw her wear it?\n",
      "19746 Big dog?\n",
      "19768 I walk into a room and he wonÂ’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.\n",
      "19772 Hey Joe.\n",
      "19781 Hey! IÂ’m sorry! ThatÂ—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?\n",
      "19783 Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?\n",
      "19785 What?!\n",
      "19787 Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that IÂ’ll stop seeing her?\n",
      "19789 Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!\n",
      "19791 All right look, if youÂ’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!\n",
      "19793 What?\n",
      "19795 All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?\n",
      "19829 (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.\n",
      "19836 The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!\n",
      "19842 Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)\n",
      "19860 How do ya do.\n",
      "19864 What happened? What happened?!\n",
      "19880 Gotcha! (laughs)\n",
      "19882 Sorry!\n",
      "19884 Okay, okay, you got it!\n",
      "19891 You canÂ’t tell, but IÂ’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!\n",
      "19893 YouÂ’re right, and IÂ’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wonÂ’t say another word tonight.\n",
      "19895 Absolutely!\n",
      "19936 So?\n",
      "19938 Yeah?\n",
      "19940 Man, this is\n",
      "19952 Our eyes are closed and weÂ’re about to cross the street. Very good.\n",
      "19972 (entering) Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?\n",
      "19974 No-no, I donÂ’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!\n",
      "19976 KathyÂ’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!\n",
      "19980 IÂ’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!\n",
      "19982 This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!\n",
      "20004 Oh man! I am so excitedÂ—I may vomit!\n",
      "20006 Look you donÂ’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. YÂ’know youÂ’re never know whatÂ’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!\n",
      "20008 Oh yeah, itÂ’s beautiful country up there.\n",
      "20010 ItÂ’s not gonna be exactly like last time.\n",
      "20013 Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!\n",
      "20017 (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) ItÂ’s Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)\n",
      "20019 HeÂ’s not gonna make it, heÂ’s stuck in Chicago.\n",
      "20021 Stupid, useless Canadian money!\n",
      "20100 Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.\n",
      "20103 Oh-no, yÂ’know with Gandolf weÂ’d be out all night!\n",
      "20114 And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?\n",
      "20116 All right!!\n",
      "20118 Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?\n",
      "20120 Well, those were seals, man.\n",
      "20148 Yeah, all right.\n",
      "20154 Actually, me too.\n",
      "20161 Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?\n",
      "20166 YÂ’know what? WeÂ’re not sad, weÂ’re not sad, weÂ’re just not 21 anymore. YÂ’know? IÂ’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!\n",
      "20218 Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?\n",
      "20222 Were you so late because you were burring this woman?\n",
      "20224 How can she be great if sheÂ’s from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke wouldÂ’ve killed in Albany.\n",
      "20226 Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) TheyÂ’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.\n",
      "20228 All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I canÂ’t believe I missed it.\n",
      "20230 Really?! I didnÂ’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.\n",
      "20233 YÂ’know what? ThereÂ’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?\n",
      "20235 Well, I have a girlfriend, IÂ’m-IÂ’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.\n",
      "20237 Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?\n",
      "20250 Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whoÂ’s boss.\n",
      "20256 (he glares at him for a while) Yes.\n",
      "20257 I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, IÂ’m not asking for me, IÂ’mÂ…",
      " I meanÂ…",
      " No, IÂ’m-IÂ’m not gay, IÂ’m not asking you out. IÂ’m not-IÂ’m not-IÂ’m not gay!\n",
      "20259 See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.\n",
      "20261 Oh, yÂ’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.\n",
      "20263 (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.\n",
      "20268 Oh well, thatÂ’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!\n",
      "20270 Well, I donÂ’t really know what that is, but letÂ’s!!\n",
      "20283 (entering) Hello, children!\n",
      "20285 (to Rachel) Have I got the 50 guys for you!\n",
      "20287 Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! TheyÂ’re buying me drinks! TheyÂ’re giving me stuff! (to Joey) Knicks tonight?\n",
      "20289 Wherever! IÂ’ve got like 20!\n",
      "20291 YÂ’know what, IÂ’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more.\n",
      "20293 Guys are signing over their 401-KÂ’s to me?\n",
      "20295 (pause) Yes. (to Rachel) Okay, thereÂ’s this one guy, Patrick, I think youÂ’re gonna like him, heÂ’s really nice, heÂ’s funny, heÂ’s a swimmer.\n",
      "20297 Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.\n",
      "20299 See, IÂ’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?\n",
      "20301 Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.\n",
      "20303 ItÂ’s a big company, I donÂ’tÂ—if youÂ—I\n",
      "20312 Oh yeah! With who?\n",
      "20314 Yeah.\n",
      "20320 Hey, man!\n",
      "20332 Well, like father, like son.\n",
      "20334 Really?! I-I thought you werenÂ’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.\n",
      "20336 Ummmmmmmm, no.\n",
      "20338 Why not?! IÂ’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getÂ—oh I see.\n",
      "20361 (interrupting) Oh, yÂ’know, yÂ’know what Pheebs?\n",
      "20363 IÂ’m not Jewish, so\n",
      "20365 Bad dream?\n",
      "20367 Oh yeah, then uh, what was PhoebeÂ’s song about?\n",
      "20374 Prague?\n",
      "20377 I did! I absolutely did!\n",
      "20379 IÂ’m sure youÂ’re right, but why?\n",
      "20381 Oh, man. IÂ’m sorry, IÂ’m so-so sorry.\n",
      "20383 I know! I know!\n",
      "20385 Well, yÂ’know, youÂ’re-youÂ’re gonna meet somebody! YouÂ’re a great catch! YÂ’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnÂ’t have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)\n",
      "20387 Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?\n",
      "20389 Oh, it doesnÂ’t matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, yÂ’know what, IÂ’ve got two tickets to tonightÂ’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?\n",
      "20391 Well, actually itÂ’s a hockey team, so itÂ’s angry Canadians with no teeth.\n",
      "20393 Have you ever been with a woman?\n",
      "20395 So there is no good time to ask that question.\n",
      "20448 I donÂ’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.\n",
      "20450 Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.\n",
      "20452 Well, you-you know what I meant.\n",
      "20454 So what job did you get Joe?\n",
      "20474 YouÂ’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?\n",
      "20489 Oh, yeah, sure, itÂ’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants.\n",
      "20493 Yes. Right where?\n",
      "20495 Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.\n",
      "20497 All right, we havenÂ’t had sex yet. Okay, whatÂ’s the big deal? YÂ’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.\n",
      "20501 No, heÂ’s right, IÂ’m totally lying.\n",
      "20503 Well, KathyÂ’s last boyfriend was Joey.\n",
      "20505 No, IÂ’m afraid I wonÂ’t be able to make love as well as him.\n",
      "20507 Yes, and I was saying the actual words.\n",
      "20509 We share a wall! So either heÂ’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.\n",
      "20511 Yeah?\n",
      "20517 All right, all right, IÂ’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But IÂ’m just doing it for you guys.\n",
      "20564 Hi.\n",
      "20566 Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?\n",
      "20571 Yes, yes, we had the sex.\n",
      "20573 It was fine, yÂ’know? But she didnÂ’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, \"I see you point, IÂ’m all right with it.\"\n",
      "20576 Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yÂ’know, I know where everything goes, itÂ’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, \"My God! SomebodyÂ’s killing her in there!\"\n",
      "20578 Look, you donÂ’t have to draw an actual woÂ—whoa! SheÂ’s hot!\n",
      "20580 (shocked) There are seven?!\n",
      "20582 (Points to one) ThatÂ’s one?\n",
      "20584 Oh, yÂ’know-yÂ’know what, I was looking at it upside down.\n",
      "20587 That-thatÂ’s bad?\n",
      "20589 Well you might if it were anything like 7!\n",
      "20651 You!\n",
      "20654 Well the vet seems to think thatÂ’s sheÂ’s becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) WeÂ’re getting a second opinion.\n",
      "20663 Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.\n",
      "20672 I can check that for ya.\n",
      "20674 WellÂ…",
      " we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.\n",

      "20682 Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.\n",
      "20690 (to Ross) Stop that now!\n",
      "20691 Yes!\n",
      "20693 Diet soda.\n",
      "20695 Orange juice.\n",
      "20701 Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in JoeyÂ’s ear.)\n",
      "20703 I got it! ScotchÂ…",
      " tape. (TheyÂ’re right.)\n",
      "20705 Well, we used thereÂ’s up last night making scary faces.\n",

      "21051 Well, that is what happened, and I donÂ’t even see you denying this!\n",
      "21053 Yeah, well, donÂ’t expect that to happen anytime soon!\n",
      "21087 Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girlÂ’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!\n",
      "21090 I confronted her, and she didnÂ’t deny it! (Pause) I donÂ’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)\n",
      "21096 Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak JulieÂ’s\n",
      "21098 Yes! See you and I have always been likeÂ—(motions that they think the same.)\n",
      "21127 Did she call?\n",
      "21129 All right, maybe I should call her.\n",
      "21132 Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?\n",
      "21134 Well y'know, what if she didnÂ’t actually sleep with the guy?\n",
      "21136 She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!\n",
      "21138 ThatÂ’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.\n",
      "21140 Oh my God!!\n",
      "21166 Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that IÂ’m sorry. YÂ’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.\n",
      "21168 Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yÂ’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? Â‘Cause weÂ’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. YÂ’know, I know for meÂ—(Notices a pair of menÂ’s pants on the chair.) NickÂ’s pants?\n",
      "21170 Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!\n",
      "21192 Well, she wasnÂ’t sleeping with him.\n",
      "21194 She is now.\n",
      "21196 IÂ’m saying that sheÂ…",
      " is a devil woman! YÂ’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I donÂ’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.\n",
      "21198 Because, I-I shouldÂ’ve called! YÂ’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldÂ’ve gone out with Nick, and they wouldÂ’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!\n",
      "21215 You donÂ’t have to stop having fun just because IÂ’m here. Kathy didnÂ’t cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)\n",
      "21225 (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.\n",
      "21262 YÂ’know, I canÂ’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on IÂ’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!\n",
      "21338 ThatÂ’s right! Where are the guys? IÂ’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.\n",
      "21340 They got a breakfast buffet.\n",
      "21342 Ooh, let me talk to him!\n",
      "21344 Well, can I just\n",
      "21346 SheÂ’s shhing me! ItÂ’s my phone and sheÂ’s shhing me!\n",
      "21352 Ow!\n",
      "21354 Maybe, she doesnÂ’t hit him all the time.\n",
      "21360 Okay, IÂ’m going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)\n",
      "21365 So yÂ’know, uh, whenÂ’s he getting back?\n",
      "21367 YÂ’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)\n",
      "21369 Yes you can. YouÂ’re thinking about time, you canÂ’t go back in time.\n",
      "21372 (laughs) No you canÂ’t.\n",
      "21374 You donÂ’t want to be guys, youÂ’d be all hairy and wouldnÂ’t live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)\n",
      "21376 Okay. (Starts to cry)\n",
      "21394 No thanks, Mom!\n",
      "21405 Ahh, come on! YÂ’know whatÂ—yÂ’know what, I think IÂ’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.\n",
      "21407 No! That was a test! In a couple of hours IÂ’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, IÂ’m gonna get so drunk, IÂ’m gonna wanna call Janice\n",
      "21409 Ohhh!!\n",
      "21430 Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!\n",
      "21436 All right, well IÂ’m gonna put my sweats back on.\n",
      "21438 Yeah?\n",
      "21440 Stripping!\n",
      "21444 Okay, look, IÂ’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.\n",
      "21446 Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnÂ’t picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)\n",
      "21455 (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!\n",
      "21457 I am totally picturing you with all those women!\n",
      "21459 Well, IÂ’m there too!\n",
      "21461 Stop it! YouÂ’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!\n",
      "21463 Where I donÂ’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!\n",
      "21464 Come on, let me see that smile.\n",
      "21466 Please?\n",
      "21468 I know, I know, but youÂ’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.\n",
      "21489 All right ladies, hereÂ’s what weÂ’re gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, \"ChandlerÂ’s the king! ChandlerÂ’s the king!\"\n",
      "21491 Oh, thatÂ’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.\n",
      "21493 Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!\n",
      "21496 What do you want from me, IÂ’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, IÂ’m sorry you canÂ’t stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing ChandlerÂ’s back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, IÂ’ve got to wake up!\n",
      "21498 Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!\n",
      "21500 ThatÂ’s a mailman! ThatÂ’s our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?\n",
      "21502 Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?\n",
      "21514 (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!\n",
      "21518 IsnÂ’t this amazing?\n",
      "21525 Okay. Bye.\n",
      "21527 Bye.\n",
      "21529 Bye.\n",
      "21531 B-bye!\n",
      "21533 Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After itÂ’s closed) I canÂ’t stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)\n",
      "21535 Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityÂ—Well, theyÂ’re all back! YÂ’know? And sheÂ’s picked up like nine new ones!\n",
      "21537 DonÂ’t worry about it. IÂ’m taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)\n",
      "21539 (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I donÂ’t have to break up with her this time. WeÂ’re not involved! IÂ’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! IÂ’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)\n",
      "21564 Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.\n",
      "21566 (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. IÂ’m just getting out of a very serious relationship\n",
      "21568 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.\n",
      "21570 I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!\n",
      "21572 No! No! Not, Paris.\n",
      "21574 Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. ThatÂ’s right, yes, IÂ’m being transferred to Yemen!\n",
      "21576 I donÂ’t know exactly.\n",
      "21578 But I do know that itÂ’s some time tomorrow.\n",
      "21595 YÂ’know uh, you didnÂ’t really have to help me pack.\n",
      "21597 Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!\n",
      "21599 Oh, IÂ’m packing. YÂ’know IÂ’m-IÂ’m packing Â‘cause IÂ’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.\n",
      "21601 IÂ’m only going to pretend IÂ’m moving to Yemen, itÂ’s the only way I can get rid off her.\n",
      "21606 (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!\n",
      "21620 (from his bedroom) Thanks!\n",
      "21652 YÂ’know you, really didnÂ’t have to take me to the airport.\n",
      "21654 Well, weÂ’re really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.\n",
      "21656 Okay. Then I guess itÂ’s just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.\") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.\n",
      "21658 Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.\n",
      "21660 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?\n",
      "21662 No. All right, yÂ’know what, sheÂ’s (Points to Janice) gonna think that IÂ’m handing you a credit card, but what IÂ’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.\n",
      "21665 (to the ticket agent) American Express?\n",
      "21730 Well, I-I guess I gotta go.\n",
      "21732 Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.\n",
      "21734 Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.\n",
      "21736 No!\n",
      "21738 Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!\n",
      "21740 Well, I then guess IÂ’m going to Yemen! IÂ’m going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?\n",
      "21750 Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.\n",
      "21758 What are you writing?\n",
      "21760 Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of styleÂ—what did you throw away?\n",
      "21761 Hi guys!\n",
      "21765 Without me?!\n",
      "21778 Yes, but in RossÂ’s case, they both know in two weeks thatÂ’s it.\n",
      "21783 Maybe thatÂ’s because soy-burgers suck!\n",
      "21808 What are you talking about?\n",
      "21819 Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)\n",
      "21821 Like what?\n",
      "21823 I said, \"Like what?\"\n",
      "21849 Does for me.\n",
      "21854 Flashdance.\n",
      "21856 She was a welder.\n",
      "21874 What are the odds? What are the odds?\n",
      "21885 Okay.\n",
      "21886 ThereÂ’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)\n",
      "21975 Hey.\n",
      "21977 Oh-ho, yeah!\n",
      "22003 TreegerÂ’s snaking the shower drain.\n",
      "22006 Hey!\n",
      "22008 Do we pay for this?\n",
      "22010 Maybe we shouldnÂ’t pay our phone billÂ—free phone sex.\n",
      "22013 Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!\n",
      "22015 Like finding money with naked people on it!\n",
      "22019 We donÂ’t know what could make this go away.\n",
      "22021 And no one touches the air around the TV!\n",
      "22024 We still have porn.\n",
      "22033 Or a job where you donÂ’t have to carry a table.\n",
      "22111 ItÂ’s the theme from Good Will Humping.\n",
      "22115 Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?\n",
      "22124 They donÂ’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.\n",
      "22131 Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?\n",
      "22137 All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, itÂ’s over.\n",
      "22139 What?\n",
      "22141 Okay. (Pause) Good one.\n",
      "22146 Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.\n",
      "22148 Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.\n",
      "22154 Pregnant Woman Slays Four?\n",
      "22161 WhatÂ’s the second part of your plan?\n",
      "22175 You put your fist through the wall?\n",
      "22200 A place where no one will ever get out alive?\n",
      "22217 Are we in London?\n",
      "22233 Hey.\n",
      "22235 I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnÂ’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.\n",
      "22237 What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"\n",
      "22239 YÂ’know what, we have to turn off the porn.\n",
      "22241 All right, ready?\n",
      "22243 Two.\n",
      "22245 Yeah, thatÂ’s kinda a relief.\n",
      "22247 You wanna see if we still have it?\n",
      "22249 FREE PORN!!!\n",
      "22251 We have free porn here!!!\n",
      "22254 Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.\n",
      "22256 All right.\n",
      "22265 WouldnÂ’t that be Frank the III?\n",
      "22293 Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?\n",
      "22295 Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.\n",
      "22299 Hey, yÂ’know what, if youÂ’re gonna do that, if youÂ’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesnÂ’t think so.) Oh, come on! ChandlerÂ’s funny, sophisticated, and heÂ’s very loveable, once you get to know him.\n",
      "22301 Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, heÂ’ll be there. And heÂ’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youÂ’re really hot.\n",
      "22316 Hey!\n",
      "22318 And now youÂ’re giving me the message!\n",
      "22322 You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?\n",
      "22325 Hi! Hi! YouÂ’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.\n",
      "22335 Raymond Chandler.\n",
      "22337 Okay, there are no famous JoeyÂ’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.\n",
      "22340 Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, heÂ’ll never be President. ThereÂ’s never gonna be a President Joey.\n",
      "22342 Wow, youÂ’re, youÂ’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.\n",
      "22344 Okay.\n",
      "22430 No, no, youÂ’re right, it is a ridiculous name!\n",
      "22432 Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.\n",
      "22434 I have no name.\n",
      "22436 Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.\n",
      "22438 Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?\n",
      "22440 ItÂ’s Clint. ItÂ’s Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)\n",
      "22443 ItÂ’s Clint! Clint!\n",
      "22474 (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?\n",
      "22476 All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.\n",
      "22478 Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, itÂ’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with womenÂ…",
      " So, as of 4 oÂ’clock tomorrow, IÂ’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.\n",
      "22480 (pleased) Really?!\n",
      "22482 Okay. Thanks.\n",
      "22484 You wanna hug it out?\n",
      "22487 Yay!\n",
      "22489 Okay!\n",
      "22491 Bye, Pheebs!\n",
      "22493 Ha! Ha! Ha!\n",
      "22538 Ho! Ho! Ho!\n",
      "22540 Your pants!\n",
      "22544 Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesnÂ’t get it.) Santa ClausÂ’s pants.\n",
      "22551 Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I donÂ’t belong here.\"\n",
      "22558 Yeah we do!\n",
      "22562 Are you serious?\n",
      "22567 Forget it! Okay, IÂ’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!\n",
      "22570 No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.\n",
      "22573 (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?\n",
      "22576 Forget it! Okay, IÂ’m not giving up the apartment.\n",
      "22580 Oh my God!\n",
      "22583 You do know that Wham broke up?\n",
      "22586 Where is Emily?\n",
      "22588 Man, didnÂ’t she like just get here?\n",
      "22590 Easy tiger.\n",
      "22592 So what are you going to do?\n",
      "22596 Are you serious?\n",
      "22598 Because youÂ’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, IÂ’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge IÂ’ve had a longer relationship with!\n",
      "22600 And I love the milk! But, IÂ’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.\n",
      "22605 Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.\n",
      "22609 No thank you.\n",
      "22611 Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we canÂ’t leave in the small apartment after weÂ’ve lived here! DidnÂ’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?\n",
      "22613 Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.\n",
      "22615 Screw the Knicks!\n",
      "22617 I didnÂ’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.\n",
      "22619 And the Knicks rule all.\n",
      "22622 No. No. WeÂ’re not gonna do that, yÂ’know why? Because its not an even trade.\n",
      "22632 No!\n",
      "22634 Op, op, IÂ’m convinced!\n",
      "22636 All right, but you canÂ’t use that again for a whole year. IÂ’m in.\n",
      "22642 Okay!\n",
      "22654 Fine, letÂ’s do it.\n",
      "22659 Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first\n",
      "22662 ThatÂ’s a low one!\n",
      "22666 Why are you screaming and hugging?\n",
      "22675 Yeah baby!\n",
      "22679 Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) ThatÂ’s courtside baby!\n",
      "22681 No they didnÂ’t!\n",
      "22716 Those were like the best seats ever.\n",
      "22718 Oh yeah, thatÂ’s very nice. Plus, yÂ’know they were free and theyÂ’re too small.\n",
      "22719 Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)\n",
      "22721 I KNOW!!!\n",
      "22722 Open up! Open up! Open up!\n",
      "22724 What the hell is going on?!\n",
      "22727 We are switching back, right now!\n",
      "22729 Well, youÂ’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, weÂ’re switching it back! ThereÂ’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?\n",
      "22731 What?\n",
      "22733 I donÂ’t care, this is our apartment! And they stoleÂ—you stole itÂ—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. IÂ’m getting back right now!\n",
      "22735 Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You canÂ’t offer anything to us!\n",
      "22738 Totally worth it!\n",
      "22740 Good night.\n",
      "22749 Okay!\n",
      "22762 Oh, well, thatÂ’s great!\n",
      "22774 Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!\n",
      "22776 Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?\n",
      "22777 Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when youÂ’re not working here?\n",
      "22779 Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)\n",
      "22781 Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because IÂ’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!\n",
      "22784 ItÂ’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!\n",
      "22786 They donÂ’t have those.\n",
      "22791 Next time you snore, IÂ’m rolling ya over!\n",
      "22794 Hey, all right!\n",
      "22808 Oh, sheÂ’s got you running errands, yÂ’know, picking up wedding dressesÂ…",
      " (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!\n",
      "22810 YÂ’know, whipped! Wah-pah!\n",
      "22812 ThatÂ’s what I did. Wah-pah!\n",
      "22864 All right buddy, time to roll over. (Rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (Looking down) No-no! (Covers his eyes) No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! YouÂ’re going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!\n",
      "22876 ItÂ’s 6:00.\n",
      "22879 Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thatÂ’s, I think thatÂ’s really cool.\n",
      "22882 What?\n",
      "22884 Yeah, well, I donÂ’t dance at weddings.\n",
      "22886 Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like thisÂ…",
      " (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)\n",
      "22888 Hey!\n",
      "22890 Nothing.\n",
      "22925 (answering for him) Yes he did.\n",
      "22927 (waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!\n",
      "22930 YouÂ’re coming on to the entire room! (He goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) IÂ’m Chandler.\n",
      "22932 Hi.\n",
      "22934 You mind if I\n",
      "22936 So uh, what are you in for?\n",
      "22938 What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.\n",
      "22970 (entering) Hello! Little ones.\n",
      "22974 Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (TheyÂ’re stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.\n",
      "22976 Because IÂ’m cooler.\n",
      "22978 Well sheÂ’s, sheÂ’s the kinda girlÂ—Joey was unconscious.\n",
      "22985 Plus, you look cool.\n",
      "23031 YÂ’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.\n",
      "23033 Phoebe is, making people.\n",
      "23035 And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!\n",
      "23037 No-no, not something stupid, something huge.\n",
      "23039 Why not?! I mean itÂ’s just, itÂ’s just climbing! ItÂ’s just, itÂ’s just steep!\n",
      "23041 WeÂ’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!\n",
      "23046 Yeah baby!\n",
      "23048 (dejected) Yeah, well\n",
      "23050 Yeah, we could do that without yÂ’know risking our lives at all!\n",
      "23052 (dejected) Oh, well\n",
      "23054 Yeeeeahhhh.\n",
      "23056 But IÂ’ll tell you something. One of these days weÂ’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!\n",
      "23073 And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)\n",
      "23141 Uh-oh.\n",
      "23148 She was not good. Not good.\n",
      "23152 Uh-oh.\n",
      "23168 (entering) Hello!\n",
      "23172 (sarcastic) Noo.\n",
      "23175 I didnÂ’t know that.\n",
      "23182 See, maybe thatÂ’s the one we shouldÂ’ve actually hidden.\n",
      "23188 This isnÂ’t one of those uh, yÂ’know \"If she doesnÂ’t come, we-we donÂ’t, we donÂ’t come?\" Right? Because I already bought my ticket\n",
      "23192 Oh, that's Ross's.\n",
      "23198 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\n",
      "23200 (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....\n",
      "23241 I KNEW IT!!!!\n",
      "23251 Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?\n",
      "23274 All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that thereÂ’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) \"ItÂ’s almost as good as being there.\"\n",
      "23276 Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.\n",
      "23278 If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.\n",
      "23289 Hey.\n",
      "23292 (shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!\n",
      "23295 Oh, itÂ’s awkward. ItÂ’s awkward. ItÂ’s awkward.\n",
      "23300 You can be the best man when I get married.\n",
      "23303 Oh no-no-no, youÂ—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.\n",
      "23305 IÂ’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!\n",
      "23308 IÂ’m not evenÂ…",
      " IÂ’m not even\n",
      "23348 (entering) Hey guys, what are you doing?\n",
      "23350 Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.\n",
      "23352 Oh, IÂ’m Ross. IÂ’m Ross. IÂ’m too good for the Hut; IÂ’m too good for the Hut.\n",
      "23356 See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.) Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.\n",
      "23358 He just said, \"No strippers.\"\n",
      "23375 (banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. IÂ’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!\n",
      "23377 Central Perk?\n",
      "23384 (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.\n",
      "23402 (opening the door) What?\n",
      "23404 Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisÂ—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! YouÂ’re the worst best man ever!\n",
      "23406 You slept with the stripper?\n",
      "23428 Hey!\n",
      "23435 So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)\n",
      "23437 So you might say, itÂ’s a magic ring.\n",
      "23440 Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why donÂ’t you be my best man.\"\n",
      "23449 Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?\n",
      "23472 (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)\n",
      "23475 Way to be cool, man.\n",
      "23481 Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)\n",
      "23511 He will, Joe.\n",
      "23521 Hey, come on, itÂ’s not your fault.\n",
      "23523 No, you should.\n",
      "23526 Really?\n",
      "23529 Thanks man.\n",
      "23531 What a baby.\n",
      "23535 Six-hour trip to London. ThatÂ’s a lot of Monica.\n",
      "23546 You got your passport?\n",
      "23549 There it is.\n",
      "23553 (entering, with Joey) All right! LetÂ’s do it!\n",
      "23557 Okay, Â‘cause thatÂ’s not gonna get annoying.\n",
      "23559 Hey, yÂ’know what? I was wrong.\n",
      "23568 Hey! (Trots over)\n",
      "23570 Oh. (Goes and gets PhoebeÂ’s book as Rachel comes in from her room.)\n",
      "23584 (entering, with PhoebeÂ’s book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.\n",
      "23592 I am, IÂ’m ignoring you.\n",
      "23594 Oh, what the hell is that?\n",
      "23596 Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!\n",
      "23598 Okay. Listen-listen, weÂ’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?\n",
      "23621 I think itÂ’s great. ItÂ’s great. YÂ’know, theyÂ’re thinking of changing the name of this place.\n",
      "23623 To Put the Camera Away!!!\n",
      "23651 Well, I donÂ’t have to buy that, \"IÂ’m with stupid\" T-shirt anymore.\n",
      "23653 All right, look, youÂ’re not really gonna buy that are you? DonÂ’t you think youÂ’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?\n",
      "23655 How can I answer that when IÂ’m pretending I donÂ’t know you?\n",
      "23657 Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?\n",
      "23659 All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yÂ’know, youÂ’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.\n",
      "23663 Okay, wait. All right, thatÂ’s it, okay, IÂ’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)\n",
      "23709 Hey. (He nods at the hat.)\n",
      "23711 No-no-no, yÂ’know what? I really shouldnÂ’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnÂ’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, IÂ’ve had a really lousy day.\n",
      "23713 Yeah?\n",
      "23721 ThatÂ’sÂ…",
      " ThatÂ’s was\n",
      "23725 How did you? How? How?\n",
      "23732 IÂ’m gonna go to the bathroom.\n",
      "23749 That was pretty intense huh?\n",
      "23751 (glares at him) I hope he did!\n",
      "23797 Joey, itÂ’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.\n",
      "23820 It couldÂ’ve been worse, he couldÂ’ve shot her.\n",
      "23836 Hey.\n",
      "23838 Oh wow, I hope you donÂ’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, IÂ’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.\n",
      "23840 Seven times!\n",
      "23842 In a foreign, romantic country\n",
      "23844 Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)\n",
      "23846 Well, I donÂ’t see that we have a choice. But, when weÂ’re back home, we donÂ’t do it.\n",
      "23848 YÂ’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs\n",
      "23850 Okay!\n",
      "23867 Forget it, thatÂ’s off.\n",
      "23873 The manÂ’s got a point.\n",
      "23892 Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, \"Yippee!\" just ignore me.\n",
      "23894 Oh, hello Rachel.\n",
      "23896 Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.\n",
      "23898 Yeah, weÂ’ll be down in like five minutes.\n",
      "23902 Oh, yay\n",
      "23909 (To Monica) Hey, listen, why donÂ’t we go change in my room?\n",
      "23911 Wow, you look\n",
      "23914 Well, IÂ’ve got a girl in here.\n",
      "23916 Well, weÂ’re-weÂ’re hanging out in here!\n",
      "23918 Well, I suppose IÂ’d have to say you!! But, what if weÂ’re watching a movie in here?\n",
      "23922 Well, Ross and Emily arenÂ’t gonna use it.\n",
      "23924 Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didnÂ’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.\n",
      "23926 Okay!\n",
      "23928 Nope, not under here!\n",
      "23931 Well, you couldnÂ’t have looked everywhere or else you wouldÂ’ve found her!\n",
      "23933 Yeah, for about 30 minutes.\n",
      "23935 Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)\n",
      "23938 Yeah, weÂ’re gonna go.\n",
      "23941 Yeah, itÂ’s a very large plane.\n",
      "23943 But, weÂ’ll stay here with you.\n",
      "23945 We have to leave for New York in an hour.\n",
      "23947 We canÂ’t do that thatÂ’s insane. I mean Â‘AÂ’ he could wake up and Â‘BÂ’ yÂ’know, letÂ’s go for it.\n",
      "23964 Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) YÂ’know, technically we still are over international waters.\n",
      "23966 Â‘Kay!\n",
      "23968 Uhh, no.\n",
      "23970 No.\n",
      "23972 Yes.\n",
      "23974 Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)\n",
      "23981 Hey!\n",
      "23984 No we didnÂ’t!\n",
      "23993 Yes! Good thing we have that, Â‘Not in New YorkÂ’ rule.\n",
      "23995 Right.\n",
      "23997 Oh. YÂ’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnÂ’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me Â‘cause, youÂ’re really hot! Is that okay?\n",
      "23999 And IÂ’m cute too.\n",
      "24001 Thank you! (They hug.) All right, I gotta go unpack.\n",
      "24003 Bye.\n",
      "24004 (entering) IÂ’m still on London time, does that count?\n",
      "24006 Oh, good! (They start kissing.)\n",
      "24060 Ehh, you're just liquored up.\n",
      "24062 I've had a very long, hard day.\n",
      "24064 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.\n",
      "24067 For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!\n",
      "24069 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.\n",
      "24071 Hey Joe!\n",
      "24072 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in\n",
      "24075 Hey, Pheebs!\n",
      "24083 Uh, The Wheatsheaf.\n",
      "24087 Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.\n",
      "24105 I can't believe she can out run you man!\n",
      "24118 Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.\n",
      "24121 Oh that's not true.\n",
      "24128 Okay, I gotta go to work.\n",
      "24129 And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.\n",
      "24130 Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)\n",
      "24153 All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?\n",
      "24162 I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.\n",
      "24164 So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)\n",
      "24232 Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)\n",
      "24234 I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.\n",
      "24239 Hey, Pheebs!\n",
      "24242 Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a littleÂ…",
      " Y'know, it didn't have anyÂ…",
      " It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!\n",
      "24286 Atlantic City!\n",
      "24293 Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!\n",
      "24298 I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.\n",
      "24299 Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.\n",
      "24301 No.\n",
      "24303 Okay. (They kiss again.)\n",
      "24320 That's right.\n",
      "24336 Oh no.\n",
      "24338 Okay.\n",
      "24340 Hey! You okay?\n",
      "24346 Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?\n",
      "24348 All right\n",
      "24354 Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.\n",
      "24374 Really? Male nurses?\n",
      "24376 So they're going on dates? When?\n",
      "24383 This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?\n",
      "24385 All right.\n",
      "24391 (spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!\n",
      "24393 Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.\n",
      "24395 Fine! Maybe I will too!\n",
      "24459 So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?\n",
      "24462 Oh.\n",
      "24464 Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)\n",

      "24755 Y'know that wasn't part of it?\n",
      "24772 Nope.\n",
      "24774 (quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)\n",
      "24776 Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)\n",
      "24781 I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.\n",
      "24783 Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.\n",
      "24785 Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)\n",
      "24790 I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.\n",
      "24797 What's going on?\n",
      "24806 Uh, hey!\n",
      "24808 We're flipping Monica's mattress.\n",
      "24812 Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)\n",
      "24817 Oh yes, somebody just said, \"Can you hear anything?\"\n",
      "24822 Condoms?\n",
      "24824 And condoms are the way to do that?\n",
      "24834 (jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!\n",
      "24836 Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.\n",
      "24838 Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!\n",
      "24840 (looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!\n",
      "24842 Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)\n",
      "24854 Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)\n",
      "24856 Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!\n",
      "24858 What? Why?\n",
      "24862 Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)\n",
      "24864 (turning to face her) Yeah.\n",
      "24866 I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.\n",
      "24868 (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!\n",
      "24870 Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?\n",
      "24872 Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?\n",
      "24874 Do not speak ill of the dead.\n",
      "24876 I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.\n",
      "24878 I said, \"Geez, relax Monnnnn.\"\n",
      "24896 Damn Rollos!\n",
      "24898 Hey.\n",
      "24900 It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)\n",
      "24902 Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.\n",
      "24908 Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.\n",
      "24910 Monica. (Follows her out.)\n",
      "24912 Okay, fine, $300.\n",
      "24914 Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!\n",
      "24932 Hi!\n",
      "24939 Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.\n",
      "24944 Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.\n",
      "24951 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "24953 Yes that was mine.\n",
      "24955 Yes that would have made more sense.\n",
      "24976 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "24978 I just came over to drop offÂ…",
      "nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?\n",
      "24980 So, I guess this is over.\n",
      "24982 Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.\n",
      "24984 Because of the weekend, we had a fight.\n",
      "24986 So, this isn't over?\n",
      "24988 Really? Okay. Great!\n",
      "24990 (stops her) We're in a relationship?\n",
      "24992 Okay.\n",
      "25000 Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)\n",
      "25003 Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)\n",
      "25007 It happened in London.\n",
      "25009 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "25011 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!\n",
      "25022 Fun's over!\n",
      "25030 Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?\n",
      "25033 Sorry.\n",
      "25039 Hello!\n",
      "25045 Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!\n",
      "25059 Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?\n",
      "25066 Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence\n",
      "25080 You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.\n",
      "25087 So you're really okay with this?\n",
      "25089 Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.\n",
      "25129 Okay, what is in here? Rocks?\n",
      "25131 So, rocks.\n",
      "25145 Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.\n",
      "25152 Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.\n",
      "25154 Well, I think it's very brave what you said.\n",
      "25156 Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?\n",
      "25180 Uh, Ross?\n",
      "25186 Yeah, we are so sorry.\n",
      "25223 Hi!\n",
      "25229 Oh yeah, there-there she is!\n",
      "25255 Are you looking at naked tribe's women?\n",
      "25257 That's a pig.\n",
      "25259 Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)\n",
      "25261 What?!\n",
      "25264 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?\n",
      "25267 Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!\n",
      "25273 He thought you said gonad.\n",
      "25326 Love what you've done with the place.\n",
      "25329 Oh yeah!\n",
      "25334 Oh, the tears are real.\n",
      "25347 What are you doing?\n",
      "25349 You built a fort didn't ya?\n",
      "25351 (notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)\n",
      "25353 I hate this thing!\n",
      "25376 (entering) Hello children!\n",
      "25378 Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)\n",
      "25381 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?\n",
      "25383 You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)\n",
      "25385 (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!\n",
      "25387 Okay.\n",
      "25388 No-no-no-no!\n",
      "25391 Okay, so he's out of here.\n",
      "25410 Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?\n",
      "25416 Not even on page 7?\n",
      "25418 What about that circled one?\n",
      "25421 Yes, it is.\n",
      "25425 There we go!\n",
      "25427 Let's go quicker.\n",
      "25430 Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.\n",
      "25434 Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.\n",
      "25439 It's a kitchen slash bathroom.\n",
      "25441 We are bad people.\n",
      "25458 Yes that was a nice place!\n",
      "25460 Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!\n",
      "25462 What are we gonna do?\n",
      "25464 About Ross!\n",
      "25467 (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?\n",
      "25468 Ohhhhh!\n",
      "25499 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!\n",
      "25501 Here we go! Here we go!\n",
      "25503 Hey!\n",
      "25506 You're kidding, no!\n",
      "25511 Yeah!\n",
      "25514 Yes! Ross, you have to stay!\n",
      "25517 All right, buddy!\n",
      "25519 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?\n",
      "25521 All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?\n",
      "25534 That's sweet, Joey.\n",
      "25537 Are you aware that you're still talking?\n",
      "25542 No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.\n",
      "25546 It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.\n",
      "25553 Really? Worse than, \"More turkey Mr. Chandler?\"\n",
      "25567 It's exactly like it sounds.\n",
      "25594 Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)\n",
      "25596 I'm over here big guy.\n",
      "25599 (laughing) You did look like an idiot.\n",
      "25606 Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.\n",
      "25625 (seeing her) Okay.\n",
      "25630 Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.\n",
      "25642 Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.\n",
      "25652 Emotional Knapsack?\n",
      "25654 Right on! Oh! Uh, but, donÂ’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.\n",
      "25656 Dude, don't do that too me!\n",
      "25658 No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.\n",
      "25663 I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!\n",
      "25665 I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!\n",
      "25668 I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.\n",
      "25674 We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!\n",
      "25689 Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)\n",
      "25693 Oh my God!\n",
      "25695 You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!\n",
      "25697 Sorry!\n",
      "25702 Sorry.\n",
      "25722 Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.\n",
      "25724 Okay.\n",
      "25726 Are you all right?\n",
      "25738 What?\n",
      "25744 Without my toe?! I need my toe!\n",
      "25748 That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!\n",
      "25750 That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!\n",
      "25752 Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)\n",
      "25756 I can't believe this.\n",
      "25758 Yeah, well, sorry doesnÂ’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.\n",
      "25760 Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)\n",
      "25761 Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, \"Quack, quack!\" IÂ’m happy all the time!\n",
      "25762 Nice try.\n",
      "25764 Look, Monica\n",
      "25766 This is not going to work.\n",
      "25768 You are so great! I love you!\n",
      "25770 Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!\n",
      "25772 No I didn't!\n",
      "25774 No I didn't!\n",
      "25776 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\n",
      "25779 Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.\n",
      "25783 Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!\n",
      "25785 See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!\n",
      "25789 Yeah!\n",
      "25798 (interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.\n",
      "25800 Well, yeah actually.\n",
      "25802 I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.\n",
      "25804 Help!\n",
      "25809 Hi, Pheebs!\n",
      "25814 I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.\n",
      "25825 Well, what did the police say?\n",
      "25827 Ross, it's just a sandwich!\n",
      "25831 (reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?\n",
      "25835 Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?\n",
      "25880 What is going on here?\n",
      "25885 Yeah.\n",
      "25887 No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.\n",
      "25889 OhÂ—I don't know.\n",
      "25937 Hey.\n",
      "25939 (gasps) You're naked in this picture!\n",
      "25941 Ross?\n",
      "25947 Which I may say, right now, is out of control.\n",
      "25952 And you're okay with that?\n",
      "25968 (Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)\n",
      "25975 All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.\n",
      "25977 Joey's a sex addict.\n",
      "25987 Well let'sÂ…",
      ".let's see what everybody thinks of that?\n",
      "25999 Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?\n",
      "26059 Why?\n",
      "26061 Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.\n",
      "26063 Okay, I'll stop.\n",
      "26066 You wanna play?\n",
      "26068 Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.\n",
      "26070 I'm intrigued.\n",
      "26072 Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.\n",
      "26074 Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?\n",
      "26081 (entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidÂ—Op! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)\n",
      "26133 (entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!\n",
      "26136 Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?\n",
      "26139 (To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.\n",
      "26142 The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.\n",
      "26146 Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?\n",
      "26150 I paid for those tickets!\n",
      "26152 Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)\n",
      "26155 When did that happen to you?!\n",
      "26157 Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.\n",
      "26164 Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!\n",
      "26168 I don't believe they're brother and sister.\n",
      "26193 Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?\n",
      "26197 Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!\n",
      "26200 Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!\n",
      "26202 All right. (Takes a copy.)\n",
      "26206 What is up?\n",
      "26208 No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.\n",
      "26210 Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)\n",
      "26212 (To Ross) I'm sorry too.\n",
      "26215 I am sorry, Ross.\n",
      "26217 This took you all day?!\n",
      "26229 (deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.\n",
      "26231 We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know\n",
      "26257 (To Monica) Happy New Year!\n",
      "26266 Do you want us to leave the room, or?\n",
      "26269 That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.\n",
      "26273 I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the \"new thing you do that day!\" (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!\n",
      "26290 Nice!\n",
      "26293 (reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?\n",
      "26295 Horn-swoggle.\n",
      "26297 No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)\n",
      "26308 What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.\n",
      "26323 (notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!\n",
      "26328 That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.\n",
      "26330 Oh come on!! (Storms out.)\n",
      "26366 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)\n",
      "26417 Oh my God!\n",
      "26430 Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.\n",
      "26463 (entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! (He sits down and sighs in relief.)\n",
      "26482 Sorry man.\n",
      "26485 Did they teach you that in your anger management class?\n",
      "26491 Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.\n",
      "26493 I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)\n",
      "26496 I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.\n",
      "26501 No, sir.\n",
      "26505 What?\n",
      "26507 Oh, that was my work laugh.\n",
      "26509 Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.\n",
      "26511 Okay.\n",
      "26513 Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!\n",
      "26515 And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (She glares at him.) Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.\n",
      "26517 Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks atÂ…",
      "bigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?\n",
      "26519 Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)\n",
      "26557 Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.\n",
      "26559 Let them win one.\n",
      "26561 You're not even giving them a chance!\n",
      "26564 Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!\n",
      "26566 Oopsey, missed it!\n",
      "26570 Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)\n",
      "26572 Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)\n",
      "26574 It was my racquet.\n",
      "26576 If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.\n",
      "26578 Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.\n",
      "26644 Just a little bit of sugar.\n",
      "26647 Oh, you get used to it.\n",
      "26649 So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?\n",
      "26651 Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)\n",
      "26653 What?\n",
      "26655 Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.\n",
      "26657 Well, I just\n",
      "26659 Really?\n",
      "26661 I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.\n",
      "26663 Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)\n",
      "26668 (from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!\n",
      "26670 But we're not ready to tell yet!\n",
      "26686 Man, she is really gullible.\n",
      "26709 Okay.\n",
      "26711 Why would I be mad?\n",
      "26713 (realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.\n",
      "26715 I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!\n",
      "26717 And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it downÂ—let's write it down!\n",
      "26720 Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!\n",
      "26722 It's your timer.\n",
      "26724 All right, then massage me up right nice!\n",
      "26725 Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!\n",
      "26727 It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!\n",
      "26729 Good-bye muscles!!\n",
      "26730 I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justÂ—I didn't know what it was!\n",
      "26732 Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.\n",
      "26736 (examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)\n",
      "26739 And you're gonna make them all disappear.\n",
      "26741 Done.\n",
      "26747 Hey.\n",
      "26793 Hey!\n",
      "26794 Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!\n",
      "26815 Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.\n",
      "26830 Oh my God!\n",
      "26845 And a date with a man!\n",
      "26861 (wincing) Yes, he is!\n",
      "26863 I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!\n",
      "26883 Hey, is Rachel here?\n",
      "26885 (coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.\n",
      "26887 (falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.\n",
      "26889 Okay, but now see you're crying!\n",
      "26891 What?\n",
      "26893 It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.\n",
      "26895 Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.\n",
      "26897 Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, \"Who's the best of that?\" They'd have to go to you.\n",
      "26899 Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!\n",
      "26901 Absolutely!\n",
      "26903 Yeah! (They hug.)\n",
      "26952 Hey man, how did the audition go?\n",
      "26958 Oh my God!\n",
      "26964 Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)\n",
      "26968 Yeah umm, they're called wallets.\n",
      "26973 And we're done with the chicken fried rice.\n",
      "26978 Or we can do the actual telephone thing.\n",
      "27029 (entering) Hello children!\n",
      "27032 Hey.\n",
      "27034 Really?\n",
      "27036 Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?\n",
      "27038 Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.\n",
      "27040 What's going on?\n",
      "27043 Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.\n",
      "27045 Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.\n",
      "27047 The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.\n",
      "27049 I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.\n",
      "27051 Ow!\n",
      "27053 Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.\n",
      "27055 No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!\n",
      "27057 Well it's not flexed right now!\n",
      "27062 Sure, I'll do it with ya.\n",
      "27075 That new mountain bike?\n",
      "27083 Your work makes me sad.\n",
      "27089 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!\n",
      "27091 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?\n",
      "27093 Are you serious?\n",
      "27095 (a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsÂ—She knows!\n",
      "27096 (entering) Joey!\n",
      "27098 Phoebe knows about us!\n",
      "27104 Oh man!\n",
      "27109 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!\n",
      "27130 Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)\n",
      "27132 Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.\n",
      "27134 Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.\n",
      "27147 Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!\n",
      "27153 (initially worried, but gets over it) Really?\n",
      "27155 Yes.\n",
      "27165 Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?\n",
      "27167 How do you know?!\n",
      "27169 At this?!\n",
      "27177 Phoebe.\n",
      "27179 Come on in.\n",
      "27181 Sure.\n",
      "27183 Me? No. You?\n",
      "27185 So do I.\n",
      "27186 I'm gonna put on some music.\n",
      "27188 You look good.\n",
      "27190 Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?\n",
      "27192 Oh, do you not want to?\n",
      "27194 (swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.\n",
      "27195 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!\n",
      "27197 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)\n",
      "27207 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?\n",
      "27209 Oh, you're-you're going?\n",
      "27211 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.\n",
      "27213 Not if I kiss you first.\n",
      "27215 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\n",
      "27217 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\n",
      "27219 Because I'm in love with Monica!!\n",
      "27221 Love her! That's right, IÂ…",
      "LOVEÂ…",
      "HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.\n",
      "27225 And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.\n",
      "27229 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n",
      "27236 (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)\n",
      "27238 Oh, I'm going on the lamb.\n",
      "27242 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.\n",
      "27245 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.\n",
      "27254 (interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!\n",
      "27259 Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.\n",
      "27279 Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.\n",
      "27313 (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.\n",
      "27319 Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.\n",
      "27321 Wh-wh-why?!\n",
      "27323 Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!\n",
      "27325 I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! IÂ’m right. I'm right. Am I right?\n",
      "27327 Okay. It's not different at all, is it?\n",
      "27335 Hmm.\n",
      "27337 Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)\n",
      "27339 Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.\n",
      "27341 I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.\n",
      "27343 What?!\n",
      "27345 Well, you do want all that stuff, right?\n",
      "27347 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!\n",
      "27349 Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!\n",
      "27351 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!\n",
      "27353 Well, I did not know that.\n",
      "27354 It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.\n",
      "27355 By me?\n",
      "27362 Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)\n",
      "27364 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.\n",
      "27366 Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.\n",
      "27429 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?\n",
      "27431 I need to talk to you, it's urgent!\n",
      "27433 Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)\n",
      "27435 (getting out a ring box) Monica\n",
      "27437 Will you marry me?\n",
      "27442 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.\n",
      "27444 I'm doing this because I'm sorry?\n",
      "27446 No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?\n",
      "27448 Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.\n",
      "27450 Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)\n",
      "27456 I didn't think I was!\n",
      "27458 Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)\n",
      "27465 Okay, how long is this going to go on.\n",
      "27468 That's not funny.\n",
      "27472 Hey!\n",
      "27475 Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?\n",
      "27477 Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?\n",
      "27487 Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.\n",
      "27491 Hey!\n",
      "27502 Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.\n",
      "27563 Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.\n",
      "27567 Hi, Joe.\n",
      "27573 Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!\n",
      "27575 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I donÂ’t want to talk about it.\n",
      "27577 You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway we're talking about your dream. (To Monica) I love you. (To Joey) Your dream? (Leans in to listen closely.)\n",
      "27584 No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.\n",
      "27589 Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?\n",
      "27591 Well there you have it!\n",
      "27594 Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?\n",
      "27599 Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.\n",
      "27646 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "27648 Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so\n",
      "27654 (looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.\n",
      "27657 Okay.\n",
      "27661 Yeah.\n",
      "27663 (straining) Okay.\n",
      "27665 Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!\n",
      "27668 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!\n",
      "27671 Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.\n",
      "27674 Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?\n",
      "27678 (stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?\n",
      "27687 Ooh, I do! I do! I do!\n",
      "27715 (To Rachel) He has a gun!\n",
      "27784 (entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.\n",
      "27786 Oh hey, how'd the interview go?\n",
      "27790 So what happened?\n",
      "27796 Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.\n",
      "27806 Come on, Rach.\n",
      "27813 I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)\n",
      "27837 (To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?\n"

      "27934 Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible.

      "28275 So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!\n",
      "28277 I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.\n",
      "28281 Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)\n",
      "28283 Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)\n",
      "28285 The one that doesn't.\n",
      "28287 Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?\n",
      "28289 Okay.\n",
      "28312 If you said, \"Big lima bean, bubbling up.\" Would she understand the difference?\n",
      "28328 Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.\n",
      "28330 You're welcome.\n",
      "28332 What?\n",
      "28336 Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.\n",
      "28339 Really?!\n",
      "28341 (starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?\n",
      "28343 Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.\n",
      "28346 Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?\n",
      "28360 (smiling) Well, what is it?\n",
      "28373 (smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?\n",
      "28379 Doesn't know, \"Hello.\" But she knows Capricorn One.\n",
      "28394 So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?\n",
      "28396 See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!\n",
      "28398 Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.\n",
      "28400 Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, \"I'm just flirting, no big deal.\" But the guy is thinking, \"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!\"\n",
      "28402 It's true.\n",
      "28404 Again true.\n",
      "28406 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.\n",
      "28413 Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.\n",
      "28442 Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)\n",
      "28451 (To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.\n",
      "28459 Oh the humanity.\n",
      "28465 More so than anything else.\n",
      "28495 Almost over man.\n",
      "28497 Why am I looking?\n",
      "28502 You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.\n",
      "28508 (singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdownÂ…",
      "enginesÂ…",
      "on!\n",
      "28515 (To Monica) Hey!\n",
      "28517 You ready?\n",
      "28519 You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.\n",
      "28521 Let me see the earrings.\n",
      "28523 (looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?\n",
      "28525 (To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.\n",
      "28529 Hey man, what's up?\n",
      "28546 Yeah, yeah! Me too!\n",
      "28548 Yeah.\n",
      "28550 Well, I like danger.\n",
      "28552 Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.\n",
      "28573 It is starting to get dark out there.\n",
      "28576 (laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.\n",
      "28587 Your tax dollars?\n",
      "28589 (leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.\n",
      "28591 I can't smell your sandwich?\n",
      "28593 Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?\n",
      "28595 Okay.\n",
      "28597 Yeah.\n",
      "28610 Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?\n",
      "28616 How do you figure that?\n",
      "28618 Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.\n",
      "28624 Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.\n",
      "28640 Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!\n",
      "28644 (deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.\n",
      "28648 What's going on?\n",
      "28653 Uh, HELLO!!\n",
      "28675 (pouting) It was a car backfire!\n",
      "28680 Who jumps at loud noises!\n",
      "28682 Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)\n",
      "28684 (returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)\n",
      "28693 Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever\n",
      "28695 No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.\n",
      "28697 You dove in front of Ross! Ross!\n",
      "28699 I do not hate Ross!\n",
      "28701 What picture?\n",
      "28703 Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!\n",
      "28705 When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.\n",
      "28707 From a bullet!\n",
      "28709 Much sense?!\n",
      "28711 So you risked your life, for a sandwich!\n",
      "28713 So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.\n",
      "28715 Really?!\n",
      "28717 Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)\n",
      "28720 (with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!\n",
      "28722 Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)\n",
      "28724 I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.\n",
      "28775 Before or after you were shot by your own troops?\n",
      "28777 Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.\n",
      "28783 (To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?\n",
      "28785 Okay.\n",
      "28786 Hiya doin' pumpkin?\n",
      "28802 (terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!\n",
      "28804 Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)\n",
      "28808 So, what are you gonna do?\n",
      "28810 Me?! Why me?\n",
      "28812 I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.\n",
      "28814 (To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)\n",
      "28861 Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)\n",
      "28863 Gary, I'm here to report a crime.\n",
      "28865 It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.\n",
      "28867 Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.\n",
      "28869 Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!\n",
      "28871 You mean scared.\n",
      "28873 Scared? Happy?\n",
      "28875 I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!\n",
      "28877 Were you're parents happy, or something?\n",
      "28879 Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.\n",
      "28881 Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!\n",
      "28883 (pause) Yeah, you're right about that.\n",
      "28919 Hi!\n",
      "28921 Yes I did, and I think you should do it.\n",
      "28923 He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.\n",
      "28925 IÂ’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.\n",
      "28928 Hey Gar!\n",
      "28952 Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?\n",
      "28954 All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)\n",
      "28956 What?\n",
      "28959 I'm not a dropper!\n",
      "28961 It's throwing and catching!\n",
      "28963 Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)\n",
      "28970 Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.\n",
      "28976 Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.\n",
      "29044 Not fun anymore?\n",
      "29071 Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!\n",
      "29073 Oh that is over!\n",
      "29084 You guys wanna eat here?\n",
      "29090 Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)\n",
      "29097 Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!\n",
      "29099 Okay, so Richard, Richard!\n",
      "29103 What?\n",
      "29111 How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the point by now.)\n",
      "29115 You okay there man?\n",
      "29124 Wow umm, calm down.\n",
      "29130 Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?\n",
      "29133 You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!\n",
      "29137 Yeah, I know that means buddy!\n",
      "29140 Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.\n",
      "29143 Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?\n",
      "29145 All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?\n",
      "29147 Thank you.\n",
      "29230 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "29232 Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)\n",
      "29233 What?\n",
      "29238 Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?\n",
      "29240 I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?\n",
      "29242 So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?\n",
      "29249 All right, bye-bye now!\n",
      "29254 Okay!\n",
      "29276 We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.\n",
      "29278 Yeah.\n",
      "29280 Isn't that Ross's money?\n",
      "29282 I don't know.\n",
      "29284 Okay!\n",
      "29286 Too dry.\n",
      "29288 No!\n",
      "29290 No!\n",
      "29292 Yes.\n",
      "29294 I also said, \"Yes!\"\n",
      "29296 No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!\n",
      "29298 Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.\n",
      "29300 They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!\n",
      "29302 Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.\n",
      "29304 Oh, you don't want me on the trip?\n",
      "29306 All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.\n",
      "29308 All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!\n",
      "29310 You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.\n",
      "29312 All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.\n",
      "29322 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "29325 Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!\n",
      "29327 I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.\n",
      "29329 Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.\n",
      "29331 Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?\n",
      "29376 (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!\n",
      "29378 Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?\n",
      "29380 That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn\n",
      "29382 Really?\n",
      "29438 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "29440 (To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!\n",
      "29445 (To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.\n",
      "29448 (To Joey) Hey!\n",
      "29450 No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!\n",
      "29452 Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!\n",
      "29455 Uh, what was that?\n",
      "29478 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "29480 I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.\n",
      "29482 Huh.\n",
      "29484 Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!\n",
      "29486 Okay.\n",
      "29488 Wow!\n",
      "29490 Do we have to?\n",
      "29492 Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.\n",
      "29494 Yeah, I think we should see other people.\n",
      "29496 Yes.\n",
      "29498 It's a great idea. (They kiss)\n",
      "29500 Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.\n",
      "29512 (coughing) Art lover!\n",
      "29514 I said art lover.\n",
      "29516 I don't know, I'm very tired.\n",
      "29527 So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.\n",
      "29529 Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.\n",
      "29531 (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.\n",
      "29533 Can I give you a present now?\n",
      "29535 Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! DonÂ’t tell me I did this!\n",
      "29537 How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?\n",
      "29539 Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!\n",
      "29541 What-what Richard thing?\n",
      "29543 What Richard thing?\n",
      "29546 (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.\n",
      "29548 Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)\n",
      "29578 Oh my God.\n",
      "29581 Love your condoms my man.\n",
      "29587 Why?! What happened?!\n",
      "29591 No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.\n",
      "29598 No! Her boyfriend Richard!\n",
      "29600 When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!\n",
      "29602 Thanks. (They hug.)\n",
      "29606 (pushing her away from another hug) Next time?\n",
      "29608 There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!\n",
      "29610 That's so funny, because I think I just did!\n",
      "29612 Fine with me!\n",
      "29616 What are you talking\n",
      "29631 Really?\n",
      "29633 (interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.\n",
      "29635 Whoa!\n",
      "29637 Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)\n",
      "29639 Good luck!\n",
      "29641 I see.\n",
      "29667 (totally confused) What?\n",
      "29669 What's an identical hand twin?\n",
      "29671 Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?\n",
      "29673 (totally confused) How?\n",
      "29675 Again I must go back to, how?\n",
      "29677 (Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.\n",
      "29679 No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!\n",
      "29685 No!\n",
      "29687 That was Joey!\n",
      "29689 Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.\n",
      "29691 Really?\n",
      "29693 Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)\n",
      "29750 (walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.\n",
      "29752 What does it look like? I'm going home.\n",
      "29754 Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.\n",
      "29756 Really?!\n",
      "29758 Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.\n",
      "29782 (arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "29785 Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)\n",
      "29809 Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!\n",
      "29811 Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?\n",
      "29813 8. 8!\n",
      "29815 If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!\n",
      "29821 Noo!\n",
      "29823 Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.\n",
      "29825 Two fours.\n",
      "29829 Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.\n",
      "29831 (sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!\n",
      "29833 Another hard 8.\n",
      "29835 Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.\n",
      "29840 You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.\n",
      "29842 Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.\n",
      "29844 Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?\n",
      "29846 Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!\n",
      "29847 (spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?\n",
      "29850 All right!\n",
      "29851 Here it is! Here it is!\n",
      "29853 It's a four.\n",
      "29904 Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.\n",
      "29906 Let's go! (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "29908 Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.\n",
      "29910 I don't think so.\n",
      "29912 (looks around) Here justÂ…",
      "take this. (Hands her the sweater.)\n",
      "29914 No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.\n",
      "29916 Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)\n",
      "29936 Hello! One marriage please!\n",
      "29939 (singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!\n",
      "29941 Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?\n",
      "29943 Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!\n",
      "29949 Oh my God!\n",
      "29952 Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!\n",
      "29955 Hey!\n",
      "29959 Yes! Well that-yes.\n",
      "29962 We actually missed it.\n",
      "29966 What?!\n",
      "29995 Hi!\n",
      "29998 So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?\n",
      "30001 ItÂ’s a buffet man.\n",
      "30003 Listen, I gotta talk to you.\n",
      "30005 Monica and I almost got married last night.\n",
      "30007 Look, I just donÂ’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! YÂ’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. YÂ’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?\n",
      "30009 What?!\n",
      "30015 (returning with Joey) Hi.\n",
      "30019 Hey!\n",
      "30021 Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or\n",
      "30027 (not quite sure) You did.\n",
      "30038 Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this oneÂ’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third oneÂ’s free.\n",
      "30048 I donÂ’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!\n",
      "30050 So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.\n",
      "30052 Yes, we donÂ’t get married unless thereÂ’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then thereÂ’s a definite sign that we should get married.\n",
      "30054 Sounds great.\n",
      "30058 Ready!\n",
      "30060 (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.\n",
      "30063 That was so unlikely. Well, letÂ’s get married! I guess.\n",
      "30065 ThatÂ’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!\n",
      "30067 Yeah. (They go pack.) WeÂ’re doing the right thing, right?\n",
      "30098 Well you did pull his hair.\n",
      "30100 IÂ’m not getting into this again!\n",
      "30102 Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)\n",
      "30104 No!\n",
      "30142 All right, should we just, should we just get married? YÂ’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.\n",
      "30144 Me too!\n",
      "30146 No!\n",
      "30148 Jeez, relax! ItÂ’s not like weÂ’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)\n",
      "30149 (entering, slowly) YÂ’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\n",
      "30151 Well, what if all my stuff was here?\n",
      "30153 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂ’m saying?\n",
      "30155 Me asking is kind of a sign.\n",
      "30157 Okay!!!!!\n",
      "30159 Okay.\n",
      "30161 Oh thanks.\n",
      "30163 The door hasnÂ’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!\n",
      "30165 Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I canÂ’t get in!\n",
      "30167 This is not a sign!\n",
      "30169 ItÂ’s an old key!\n",
      "30171 I love you!\n",
      "30173 Are you hugging the door right now.\n",
      "30175 Yeah-yeah, me neither.\n",
      "30190 The keyÂ’s stuck in the lock.\n",
      "30192 (trying the handle) It still doesnÂ’t work.\n",
      "30194 Oh.\n",
      "30195 Nice job Joe! YouÂ’re quite the craftsmen.\n",
      "30230 YÂ’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?\n",
      "30232 No. When it comes to sweets, heÂ’s surprisingly strict.\n",
      "30234 No, no, I keep trying, yÂ’know? I can get out, \"Joey, I have tooÂ…",
      "\" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, \"Â…",
      "go to the bathroom.\" He may think IÂ’m sick.\n",
      "30236 Oh, so thatÂ’s this is gonna work now? YouÂ’re just gonna order me around all the time?\n",
      "30238 All right.\n",
      "30244 No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, hereÂ’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, IÂ’m gonna be moving out man.\n",
      "30248 Look, I-IÂ’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up IÂ’m moving right back in with you!\n",
      "30278 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "30280 (looking down) What gave me away?\n",
      "30282 Okay, so thatÂ’s it, everybody knows! ItÂ’s official, weÂ’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?\n",
      "30284 Wow that was my scariest voice! YouÂ’re very brave.\n",
      "30286 Hey.\n",
      "30288 Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.\n",
      "30290 Well, I-I still think youÂ’re very-very nice and very pretty\n",
      "30292 (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)\n",
      "30299 Rach\n",
      "30322 Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?\n",
      "30324 Well, JoeyÂ’s my best friend.\n",
      "30326 You just saidÂ…",
      " Of course youÂ’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?\n",
      "30328 Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)\n",
      "30330 Hey-hey!\n",
      "30332 I am now!\n",
      "30334 Okay, bye! (Exits.)\n",
      "30350 Look, IÂ’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.\n",
      "30352 Not once did we do that.\n",
      "30354 Hey!\n",
      "30357 Oh yeah? Well, howÂ’d she take it?\n",
      "30359 And youÂ’re upset because you didnÂ’t make your best friend cry?\n",
      "30362 Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!\n",
      "30440 (entering) Hey!\n",
      "30454 Pheebs, I donÂ’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?\n",
      "30460 Hey-hey! I thought Naked ThursdayÂ’s was just our thing man!\n",
      "30483 Who was it?\n",
      "30486 Sure!\n",
      "30488 Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yÂ’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!\n",
      "30490 Okay so you mean no as in, \"Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. LetÂ’s discuss it before we reject it completely.\"\n",
      "30492 So, thatÂ’s it?\n",
      "30494 Which is why Asteroids is perfect! ItÂ’s the oldest game!\n",
      "30496 I donÂ’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!\n",
      "30498 No, IÂ’m not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)\n",
      "30500 Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.\n",
      "30502 (reading the ad) \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" Nice!\n",
      "30542 Hi.\n",
      "30544 Hi, listen, IÂ’m sorry about before. I donÂ’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnÂ’t get girls, and now I can Â‘emÂ—Now, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women\n",
      "30546 Really?\n",
      "30548 Ohh.\n",
      "30550 ThatÂ’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.\n",
      "30552 We donÂ’t have to come up with this now.\n",
      "30554 Hey, yÂ’know what? Why donÂ’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?\n",
      "30556 Yeah, I mean weÂ’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)\n",
      "30558 Is that a problem?\n",
      "30560 Oh, thatÂ’s cool. Then IÂ’ll just bring them both over.\n",
      "30562 Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! IÂ’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!\n",
      "30564 In the game room!\n",
      "30566 All right! ThatÂ’s fine! ThatÂ’s fine! I wonÂ’t bring over the chairs! I wonÂ’t bring anything over! I wouldnÂ’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at GrandmaÂ’s place!! (Storms out.)\n",
      "30570 (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! IÂ’ll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)\n",
      "30572 Why did you take the shower curtain down?\n",
      "30585 Well, why donÂ’t you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)\n",
      "30587 Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.\n",
      "30589 ThatÂ’s laughter.\n",
      "30591 I donÂ’t know.\n",
      "30593 Yeah, I do.\n",
      "30623 HeÂ’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!\n",
      "30627 Yeah, I'm not so worried.\n",
      "30631 Of course!\n",
      "30633 Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.\n",
      "30635 Okay!\n",
      "30636 Oh my God! SomeoneÂ’s killed Square Man!\n",
      "30638 Oh thatÂ’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!\n",
      "30640 YÂ’know those big-big uh, road signs that say \"Merge?\"\n",
      "30642 YÂ’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thatÂ’s you and I together! Merge!\n",
      "30644 Really?!\n",
      "30719 Hey!\n",
      "30722 Oh, whatÂ’s the matter?\n",
      "30724 Yeah?\n",
      "30726 What?!\n",
      "30732 Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youÂ’re gonna go?\n",
      "30735 Oh hi!\n",
      "30745 Why donÂ’t you open with a joke?\n",
      "30747 Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂ’re not talking about Chuckles University?!\n",
      "30757 ThatÂ’s the way I did it Â‘til I was 19.\n",
      "30758 Hey.\n",
      "30760 Yes, you got something from the Screen ActorÂ’s Guild.\n",
      "30762 (opens and reads it) \"Benefits lapsed.\"\n",
      "30764 Okay, itÂ’s not a check. TheyÂ’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didnÂ’t work enough last year.\n",
      "30766 All right.\n",
      "30768 IÂ’m sorry man, thereÂ’s never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.\n",
      "30770 Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.\n",
      "30806 Hey!\n",
      "30808 ThatÂ’s great, but shouldnÂ’t you be on the toilet right now?\n",
      "30810 WhatÂ’s wrong with you?\n",
      "30812 This sounds like a hernia. You have toÂ—you-you go to the doctor!\n",
      "30814 ThatÂ’s a hernia.\n",
      "30833 Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!\n",
      "30835 I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and letÂ’s just get that thingÂ…",
      "pushed back in.\n",
      "30838 Hey.\n",
      "30841 Oh JoeyÂ’s got a really bad hernia, but thatÂ’s nothing a little laser eye surgery wonÂ’t fix!\n",
      "30889 Listen, IÂ’m really glad you got the part.\n",
      "30891 But are you sure you can do this?\n",
      "30893 Now, is that never talking about it again?!\n",
      "30913 IÂ’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why donÂ’t you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!\n",
      "30928 What are you doing?\n",
      "30930 Oh, all right.\n",
      "30934 What?\n",
      "30939 Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?\n",
      "30944 Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youÂ’re not married to anymore of us are ya?\n",
      "30950 You left a shoe here?!\n",
      "30952 Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, IÂ’ll be sure to give him your shoe.\n",

ItÂ’s times like these IÂ’m glad Smell-O-Vision hasnÂ’t been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When youÂ’re done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)\n",

      "31171 (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that heÂ’s scratching his back with it.) Listen, IÂ’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.\n",

      "31186 So, weÂ’ll do the rest of the bills later then?\n",

      "31246 Oh, I wish IÂ’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.\n",
      "31248 Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?\n",
      "31250 Yes it would. What do you say to $50?\n",
      "31252 Okay, letÂ’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.\n",
      "31277 Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.\n",
      "31279 Oh yes!\n",
      "31281 Okay.\n",
      "31283 No! No! No! NoÂ—(Joey looks at him)Â—one can beat me.\n",
      "31284 See? Now, thatÂ’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.\n",
      "31299 Still broken?\n",
      "31301 Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)\n",
      "31303 Okay, uh, how about, how aboutÂ—yÂ’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, itÂ’s fun.\n",
      "31305 Cups.\n",
      "31307 IÂ’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, itÂ’s really easy and really, really fun.\n",
      "31309 Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?\n",
      "31311 Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!\n",
      "31313 Oh yeah! Okay, letÂ’s play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?\n",
      "31315 YouÂ’re kidding right?\n",
      "31317 Well thatÂ’s a full cup! (Pays him again.)\n",
      "31342 You win.\n",
      "31344 It doesnÂ’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?\n",
      "31346 Not 700 exactly?\n",
      "31348 Double it! (He does.)\n",
      "31350 Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.\n",
      "31352 Hey, I didnÂ’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) DonÂ’t get to excited because thatÂ’s not gonna happen unless you getÂ—No way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card wouldÂ’ve won. Chandler pays him.)\n",
      "31379 WhatÂ’s wrong?\n",
      "31381 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!\n",

      "31387 I canÂ’t take the big white dog! You love it!\n",
      "31389 No, but waitÂ—what if I bought it from you, yÂ’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?\n",
      "31391 When did I try to give you money?\n",
      "31393 IÂ’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youÂ’re okay.\n",

      "31410 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)\n",

      "31414 I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.\n",
      "31416 Exactly.\n",
      "31418 ItÂ’s not a real game! I made it up!\n",
      "31420 At a fake game!!\n",
      "31422 Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.\n",
      "31424 Hmm, letÂ’s see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)\n",
      "31463 (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.\n",
      "31466 I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.\n",
      "31468 Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.\n",
      "31477 So, uh, wh-where ya from?\n",
      "31490 Unbelievable\n",
      "31492 Hey, look at all the boxes!\n",
      "31496 All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?\n",
      "31498 Now imagine you live at the supermarket.\n",
      "31500 No-no\n",
      "31526 OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack. (Hears the giggling again)\n",
      "31528 (pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.\n",
      "31530 Yeah, not bad right? You know what, MonicaÂ’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?\n",
      "31532 Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?\n",
      "31547 What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!\n",
      "31549 Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.\n",
      "31551 Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.\n",
      "31553 She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.\n",
      "31555 She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.\n",
      "31557 I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.\n",
      "31559 No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.\n",
      "31561 Hey Mon, how's it going?\n",
      "31563 Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.\n",
      "31565 No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.\n",
      "31567 It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.\n",
      "31569 We should start with the big stuff. YÂ’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)\n",
      "31571 What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they won't reach) OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.\n",
      "31573 OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.\n",
      "31575 Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!\n",
      "31580 Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?\n",
      "31582 Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.\n",
      "31584 That's not specific to girls.\n",
      "31587 And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.\n",
      "31589 Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.\n",
      "31607 Okay, is this lamp in the same place?\n",
      "31609 (blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.\n",
      "31612 (to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.\n",
      "31619 Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.\n",
      "31621 Bye! Thank God\n",
      "31623 Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.\n",
      "31625 That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)\n",
      "31651 Uh-huh\n",
      "31654 No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)\n",
      "31656 Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n",
      "31658 Do you want me to be afraid of you?\n",
      "31660 Really?\n",
      "31662 Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.\n",
      "31668 Ba dum bumb cheshhh!\n",
      "31671 Hi, my nameÂ’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?\n",
      "31673 So, is Janine around?\n",
      "31675 Can I check out what she did to my room?\n",
      "31677 (The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is thÂ…",
      " itÂ’s like a guy never lived in here. Look, youÂ’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking around the living room.) ItÂ’s spreading already.\n",
      "31679 (Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?\n",
      "31681 (Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, thatÂ’s too small to put anything in?\n",
      "31683 No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youÂ’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.\n",
      "31685 Yes talk to her. Be a man.\n",
      "31687 Defend yourself.\n",
      "31690 Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.\n",
      "31692 Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?\n",
      "31694 Ohh, yeah.\n",
      "31713 ThatÂ’s weird. I donÂ’t think my boss likes me either.\n",
      "31717 Yeah letÂ’s head off to work.\n",
      "31763 You knowÂ…",
      "Oh My God.\n",
      "31766 (Sarcastically) Really.\n",
      "31771 Yeah, what was wrong with your oldÂ…",
      "human teeth.\n",
      "31777 No, no no no. YouÂ’ll be fine. (turning to Monica) HillaryÂ’s bind, right?\n",
      "31779 Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)\n",
      "31782 What???\n",
      "31785 I am proud of all my friends today.\n",
      "31787 Hi, IÂ’m Chandler. Your live-in boy\n",
      "31789 Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)\n",
      "31815 Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? IÂ’m going to go over to JoeyÂ’s.\n",
      "31817 Yes, but I feel like IÂ’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think weÂ’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.\n",
      "31819 Nah, Nah, itÂ’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.\n",
      "31821 You know when guys hang out they donÂ’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?\n",
      "31824 No thanks, Josephine.Scene: RossÂ’s apartment, Chandler enters. Ross is putting on makeup.]\n",
      "31825 Hey Ross, I was wondering ifÂ…",
      " Oh my God!! Where are all the men???Scene: Elevator at the Ralph Lauren offices, KimÂ’s waiting for it. The door opens and Rachel is inside.]\n",
      "31854 Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.\n",
      "31857 What is the matter with you ?!?\n",
      "31859 YouÂ’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!\n",
      "31861 YouÂ’re turning into a women.\n",
      "31863 Now IÂ’ve upset you? What did I say?\n",
      "31921 Sydney Portier? Hehheh.\n",
      "31923 Oh! ThatÂ’s great, they havenÂ’t seen the place since I moved in!\n",
      "31925 (shocked at the news) Why canÂ’t I tell them that we live together?\n",
      "31927 Why havenÂ’t you told them?!\n",
      "31929 Why havenÂ’t you told them?! WouldnÂ’t they be happy?!\n",
      "31931 Why wouldnÂ’t they be happy?\n",
      "31933 What? What? Why?!\n",
      "31935 Is this why they donÂ’t like me or why you donÂ’t like me?\n",
      "31937 YÂ’know, itÂ’ll be okay. ItÂ’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then weÂ’ll tell Â‘em.\n",
      "31939 Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnÂ’t I?\n",
      "31941 Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! YouÂ’re parents like me, right?\n",
      "31943 Well Monica just told me that they donÂ’t.\n",
      "31945 (annoyed) Do you know why?\n",
      "31947 (angry) Well if people donÂ’t know they shouldnÂ’t just guess!\n",
      "31948 This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.\n",
      "31950 Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.\n",
      "31952 [mocks that last comment].\n",
      "31954 Hey.\n",
      "32004 Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!\n",
      "32005 Whoa, snowing out there?\n",
      "32016 Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yÂ’know IÂ’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.\n",
      "32018 (worried) HeÂ’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.\n",
      "32047 Oh, yes. Well itÂ’s very beautiful. ItÂ’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I donÂ’t mean tight, I mean itÂ’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]\n",
      "32050 (shocked) What?\n",
      "32054 You do? Why?\n",
      "32056 What?! Why did you do that?\n",
      "32058 How could it not matter?!\n",
      "32060 What about all that Â“friends foreverÂ” stuff?\n",
      "32063 Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!\n",
      "32065 The reason we havenÂ’t told them weÂ’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?\n",
      "32102 Yeah, IÂ’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.\n",
      "32122 (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that IÂ’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.\n",
      "32133 (lying) Yes, but if itÂ’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.\n",
      "32165 Thank you!\n",
      "32167 (In a parent-like tone) IÂ’ll talk to them!\n",
      "32173 Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.\n",
      "32180 I dunno what it is, it just doesnÂ’t quite feel like Christmas to me.\n",
      "32182 See now it feels like Christmas!\n",
      "32186 Hey Joe whatÂ’s up?\n",
      "32188 I can see why thatÂ’s hard to resist.\n",
      "32192 You are aware that sheÂ’s not a monkey, right?\n",
      "32200 Ah, youÂ’re still just a little fat girl inside arenÂ’t you? (He kisses her on the cheek)\n",
      "32210 What, what are you laughing at?\n",
      "32216 I donÂ’t think so.\n",
      "32225 (To Rachel) Oh my God!\n",
      "32236 I can save you time ladies, IÂ’m right here.\n",
      "32239 What? ThatÂ’s terrible!\n",
      "32241 Oh well, that makes it not terrible.\n",
      "32244 No not okay, you canÂ’t look for MonicaÂ’s presents!\n",
      "32246 No, you donÂ’t have to, and you canÂ’t because I live here too.\n",
      "32248 Why?\n",
      "32250 No, I have a great idea for a present for her.\n",
      "32253 If I help, we can find Â‘em faster!\n",
      "32261 YÂ’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you donÂ’t, you donÂ’t do that every year do you?\n",
      "32263 You donÂ’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?\n",
      "32265 Because thatÂ’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that IÂ’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)\n",
      "32287 I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!\n",
      "32290 Those are my gifts, I got them for you.\n",
      "32293 Those are book ends! That's a great gift!\n",
      "32296 Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?\n",
      "32349 Oh, hey guys!\n",
      "32351 Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.\n",
      "32353 Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thatÂ’s as good as garbage?\n",
      "32359 What?\n",
      "32363 Oh great!\n",
      "32366 Okay! Okay! Okay!\n",
      "32368 Wait, we canÂ’t do this.\n",
      "32370 I donÂ’t wanna know what Monica got me. YÂ’know? I mean, look, IÂ’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.\n",
      "32372 Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I donÂ’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on MonicaÂ’s face when I give her my present, and IÂ’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?\n",
      "32374 Fine!\n",
      "32376 ThatÂ’s what you got me?\n",
      "32402 Now you do that, youÂ’re on TV.\n",
      "32412 ThatÂ’s great!\n",
      "32417 So you kissed her, so what happened after that?\n",
      "32419 So sheÂ’s just waiting over there for ya?\n",
      "32431 (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)\n",
      "32433 IÂ’m not your garbage man. IÂ’m your mailman.\n",
      "32437 A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)\n",
      "32440 You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!\n",
      "32447 You made pottery?\n",
      "32451 Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore\n",
      "32452 so then the farmer says, \"ThatÂ’s not a cow and youÂ’re not milking it.\" (Everyone laughs.)\n",
      "32454 Look at us, weÂ’re a couple of couples!\n",
      "32463 Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.\n",
      "32536 And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnÂ’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.\n",
      "32540 Oh thatÂ’s too bad.\n",
      "32545 ThatÂ’s funny, I saw no phlegm.\n",
      "32547 Then why-why is she going to a play?!\n",
      "32551 Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!\n",
      "32554 So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!\n",
      "32556 And I am not blah, I am a hoot!\n",
      "32558 No, you shÂ—No you said you made that up!!\n",
      "32560 Eh, theyÂ’re both good. I generally just go with, MonicaÂ’s drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)\n",
      "32563 Okay.\n",
      "32583 Okay, one more time.\n",
      "32585 Perfect decibel.\n",
      "32588 Hey.\n",
      "32590 Oh nothing, weÂ’re just talking. YÂ’know, blah-blah-blah.\n",
      "32642 ThatÂ’s totally understandable.\n",
      "32645 Oh yeah!\n",
      "32653 And IÂ’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) \"Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.\"\n",
      "32657 (To Monica) YÂ’know I think you can take her.\n",
      "32677 Did you hear that?\n",
      "32679 Yeah, IÂ’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?\n",
      "32683 Hey so, did uh, did she move out?\n",
      "32687 You okay?\n",
      "32699 That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.\n",
      "32701 I made that joke up.\n",
      "32703 Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke heÂ’d ever heard.\n",
      "32707 Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?\n",
      "32709 Seriously?\n",
      "32712 Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "32714 (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.\n",
      "32716 ItÂ’s my joke.\n",
      "32719 Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.\n",
      "32721 Nah, MonicaÂ’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I donÂ’t want to miss when they were skinny.\n",
      "32723 What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?\n",
      "32725 Joey, why is your cable out?\n",
      "32727 If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?\n",
      "32729 Whoa ho.\n",
      "32731 (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?\n",
      "32733 (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?\n",
      "32752 Yeah.\n",
      "32754 So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.\n",
      "32757 And monkeys canÂ’t write out prescriptions.\n",
      "32758 (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.\n",
      "32760 So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.\n",
      "32762 Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.\n",
      "32764 Yeah!\n",
      "32766 Okay (he goes to sit down).\n",
      "32776 (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.\n",
      "32778 You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? IÂ’m going to get a joke journal. YÂ’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.\n",
      "32780 Yeah!\n",
      "32782 Picking Rachel.\n",
      "32784 Maybe itÂ’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.\n",
      "32830 So is your apron. YouÂ’re wearing it like a cape.\n",
      "32837 I think itÂ’s great that you work here. YouÂ’re going to make a lot of money, and hereÂ’s your first tip: DonÂ’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.\n",
      "32872 ItÂ’s my joke.\n",
      "32874 LetÂ’s have Monica decide.\n",
      "32876 Yeah!\n",
      "32878 Mon, get out here!\n",
      "32880 Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.\n",
      "32882 Because youÂ’re the only one that can be fair.\n",
      "32886 (to Ross) DonÂ’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) IÂ’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, letÂ’s go.\n",
      "32889 Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.\n",
      "32891 Can I finish my story?!\n",
      "32895 So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And SteveÂ’s doctorÂ’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Â‘Doctor Monkey?Â’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)\n",
      "32897 IÂ’m not arguing with that.\n",
      "32901 Is not.\n",
      "32903 Hi, oh hi.\n",
      "32905 (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andÂ—(He falters and Monica prompts him.)Â—generosity of spirit.\n",
      "32909 (To Chandler) IÂ’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?\n",
      "32911 (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) YouÂ’re a little high maintenance.\n",
      "32913 IÂ’m sorry. YouÂ’re not easy-going, but youÂ’re passionate, and thatÂ’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that IÂ’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thatÂ’s good too. So, they can say that youÂ’re high maintenance, but itÂ’s okay, because I like Â…",
      " maintaining you.\n",
      "32915 (happily) IÂ’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)\n",
      "32918 Hey, buddy boy, howÂ’d the audition go?\n",
      "32938 Hey.\n",
      "32942 Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. IÂ’m not answering that.\n",
      "32945 This coming from the man who couldnÂ’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.\n",
      "32963 Hey, what are you doing here? ShouldnÂ’t you be at work?\n",
      "32966 IÂ’m so sorry youÂ’re sick.\n",
      "32970 IÂ’m gonna grab you some tissue.\n",
      "32974 Yes?\n",
      "32978 Oh my God, introduce us!\n",
      "32998 Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)\n",
      "33062 I know, letÂ’s rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)\n",
      "33064 That would be impossible to resist if you werenÂ’t all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)\n",
      "33066 Yeah, I donÂ’t you should say that even when youÂ’re healthy.\n",
      "33068 DonÂ’t take this personally okay? ItÂ’s just that I just canÂ’t have sex with a sick person.\n",
      "33070 ThatÂ’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.\n",
      "33122 Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least sheÂ’s trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!\n",
      "33124 Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.\n",
      "33126 I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! YÂ’know whatÂ’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.\n",
      "33128 Would you please get some rest!\n",
      "33148 Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!\n",
      "33150 No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.\n",
      "33152 No-no-no-no-no!\n",
      "33154 Okay.\n",
      "33155 So youÂ’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?\n",
      "33157 ItÂ’s nice.\n",
      "33159 Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)\n",
      "33161 ItÂ’s all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh, mix it up?\n",
      "33163 Oh come on you big faker!\n",
      "33165 Well that was before all the vaporizing action.\n",
      "33167 Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)\n",
      "33188 (calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?\n",
      "33190 We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.\n",
      "33196 HeÂ’s taking off her coat!\n",
      "33200 Ho-oh, heÂ’s gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. YÂ’know so umm, heÂ’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (Pause) Well, IÂ’m off to bed! (Goes to bed.)\n",
      "33206 IÂ’m good.\n",
      "33209 (looking) Is that a swing?\n",
      "33211 Yuck!\n",
      "33213 That was like 5 years ago.\n",
      "33215 Joey\n",
      "33245 (totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!\n",
      "33247 Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!\n",
      "33249 IÂ’m not macho.\n",
      "33251 No, I guess I just never really cried. YÂ’know? IÂ’m not a crying kind of guy.\n",
      "33253 IÂ’d be sad sure, but I wouldnÂ’t cry.\n",
      "33255 Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, IÂ’m rich!\n",
      "33258 Oh, thatÂ’s ParentÂ’s Day, first grade. ThatÂ’s me with the janitor Martin.\n",
      "33260 Oh they didnÂ’t want to come!\n",
      "33264 No! Look, I donÂ’t cry! ItÂ’s not a big deal! Okay?!\n",
      "33317 You didnÂ’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?\n",
      "33322 Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.\n",
      "33329 Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I donÂ’t do porn.\n",
      "33345 Her ankle is what youÂ’re watching?\n",
      "33347 SheÂ’s just doing her job!\n",
      "33353 Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)\n",
      "33355 ThereÂ’s no back to this couch!\n",
      "33357 Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yÂ’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnÂ’t think I was yÂ’know, all dead inside.\n",
      "33359 Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.\n",
      "33361 No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, weÂ’re up at the altar and IÂ’m like this. (Makes a bored face.)\n",
      "33363 Yeah?\n",
      "33365 Okay, well I wonÂ’t uh, worry about this anymore then.\n",
      "33367 Aww, I love you so\n",
      "33369 What?!\n",
      "33371 So you didnÂ’t mean any of that?!\n",
      "33429 Hey.\n",
      "33434 (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.\n",

      "33475 Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.\n",
      "33477 Sure I would!\n",
      "33479 What, you guys really think that IÂ’m that shallow?\n",
      "33482 What if I had had the guts to quit my job? IÂ’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobÂ’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I donÂ’t have to wear a tie.\n",
      "33521 (entering, depressed) Hey.\n",
      "33524 Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not \"Archie Comic funny.\"\n",
      "33530 Was his question whatÂ’s more boring than him?\n",
      "33532 Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.\n",
      "33534 Ehh.\n",
      "33539 I could use the money; it could give me time to write.\n",
      "33541 Okay!\n",
      "33543 All right!\n",
      "33556 Hey.\n",
      "33567 Well itÂ’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that heÂ’s not real.\n",
      "33583 Uh-oh, itÂ’s my boss!\n",
      "33585 (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.\n",
      "33587 What?\n",
      "33592 But the Kit-Kats are all right?!\n",
      "33596 Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!\n",
      "33604 I always thought having a heart attack was natureÂ’s way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But youÂ’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youÂ’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.\n",
      "33626 Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, \"Bring me food.\" Two is, \"IÂ’m with a girl, bring us food.\" Three is, \"IÂ’m lost and I canÂ’t find food.\"\n",
      "33641 (approaching) Here you go Joe, hereÂ’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)\n",
      "33643 Yeah?\n",
      "33645 IÂ’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.\n",
      "33649 Okay, anything for you sir?\n",
      "33653 ItÂ’s not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)\n",
      "33666 Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!\n",
      "33668 Aww.\n",
      "33670 You wanna share it?\n",
      "33675 WhatÂ’s this?\n",
      "33677 Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)\n",
      "33680 Oh you wouldnÂ’t uh, care. ItÂ’s just a stupid comic book story.\n",
      "33682 Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesnÂ’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistÂ—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that canÂ’t have lumps in them.\n",
      "33746 No, the doctors say it may kill her.\n",
      "33748 (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.\n",
      "33751 Listen Phoebe, heÂ’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.\n",
      "33755 Uh, what about yÂ’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.\n",
      "33794 IÂ’m sorry youÂ’re here with me instead of Roger.\n",
      "33796 Well, I could make it seem like heÂ’s here. (Imitates him.) \"HereÂ’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnÂ’t add the second cous until 1979.\" (Mumbles something further.)\n",
      "33798 Okay.\n",
      "33800 What was tonight?\n",
      "33802 Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?\n",
      "33804 With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!\n",
      "33806 Four different women! IÂ’ve had sex way more times!\n",
      "33808 Nine.\n",
      "33810 Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?\n",
      "33812 Hey thatÂ’s what I tell girls about me.\n",
      "33814 No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.\n",
      "33816 Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)\n",
      "33818 So was I.\n",
      "33829 We canÂ’t do this.\n",
      "33831 Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, yÂ’know? Because youÂ’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldnÂ’t want to disappoint you.\n",
      "33833 I do like that.\n",
      "33835 Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?\n",
      "33837 Stop it! WeÂ’re doing this! LetÂ’s do it!\n",
      "33839 Okay! (They both get up.)\n",
      "33841 I have some moves.\n",
      "33843 Yeah, letÂ’s just forget it.\n",
      "33845 Okay!\n",
      "33846 Oh yeah.\n",
      "33848 (sexily) Yeah?\n",
      "33850 Oh my God!\n",
      "33852 Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)\n",
      "33911 Hey!\n",
      "33913 Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!\n",
      "33915 So you uh, want to do something tonight?\n",
      "33917 Oh. Oh right! Right! Because youÂ’re still seeing him and uh, heÂ’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time whenÂ…",
      " (He fakes falling asleep.)\n",
      "33919 Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?\n",
      "33921 I bet he can.\n",
      "33923 Oh yeah! Yeah! DonÂ’t worry about me, IÂ’ll be fine! (Does a kara-tay move.)\n",
      "33980 (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?\n",
      "33982 Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?\n",
      "33984 IÂ’m the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)\n",
      "33986 Because you shouldnÂ’t be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.\n",
      "33988 Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they donÂ’t just happen. YÂ’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yÂ’know I was just lying there and I couldnÂ’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yÂ’know with a friend.\n",
      "33990 I know you probably donÂ’t want to go out with me, yÂ’know because I make too many jokes and IÂ’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess IÂ’m not technically a \"doctorÂ…",

      "34054 Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to Ross flashing Joey a very evil look; Joey gets scared) I canÂ’t do that we promised weÂ’d make each other gifts this year.\n",

Then he holds it out as if heÂ’s giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I canÂ’t do it. I canÂ’t do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking.

      "34492 So?!\n",
      "34494 ItÂ’s Thursday! How was the audition?!\n",
      "34512 Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. (Pats JoeyÂ’s arm, Joey pats ChandlerÂ’s shoulder, and Chandler motions for Joey to say the same about him.)\n",
      "34521 So he has to be a male who has at least $50.\n",
      "34529 (laughs) IsnÂ’t she cute? (On MonicaÂ’s death stare) No!\n",
      "34540 So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?\n",
      "34542 Oh, tell her good luck with that.\n",
      "34556 Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?\n",
      "34560 Oh thatÂ’s so funny because we found someone too.\n",
      "34562 Why would our guy be a weirdo?\n",
      "34568 A face ass?\n",
      "34572 No, our guy is just a floating head.\n",
      "34576 (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.\n",
      "34582 Our guy has great hair.\n",
      "34584 Our guy smells incredible.\n",
      "34586 Hey.\n",
      "34588 Well, youÂ…",
      "donÂ’t look good Joe.\n",
      "34590 ThatÂ’s still in there?!\n",
      "34592 Is this a service youÂ’re providing me?\n",
      "34594 Our new fridge? I donÂ’t live here anymore.\n",
      "34596 Uh-huh.\n",
      "34598 (not quite sure where JoeyÂ’s going and is a little worried) Okay\n",
      "34617 Just tell her the truth! Tell her youÂ’re not ready.\n",
      "34619 Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.\n",
      "34625 Joey, I saw you push him!\n",
      "34629 Uh-huh.\n",
      "34645 Hey!\n",
      "34649 Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)\n",
      "34655 I can see it now, \"Look dad, itÂ’s the Sphinx!\" (Does that party noise again.)\n",
      "34659 Yeah.\n",
      "34672 Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!\n",
      "34680 Are you funny?\n",
      "34689 (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.\n",
      "34691 Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A catÂ’s name?\n",
      "34696 Okay, so you will meet our guys?\n",
      "34698 Okay now it doesnÂ’t matter which one you choose, yÂ’know? ItÂ’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.\n",
      "34705 (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?\n",
      "34708 You know the hotels?\n",
      "34717 Well, maybe you donÂ’t marry this one.\n",
      "34730 Good-good-good-good.\n",
      "34732 Hey!\n",
      "34738 Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, yÂ’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)\n",
      "34743 Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!\n",
      "34745 There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)\n",
      "34749 Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, youÂ’re too late okay? Because sheÂ’s already with our guy.\n",
      "34768 It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)\n",
      "34773 (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!\n",
      "34799 So what was it for anyway?\n",
      "34808 Yeah.\n",
      "34823 (To Joey) So uh, whatÂ’s this thing youÂ’re auditioning for?\n",
      "34827 That is lucky.\n",
      "34830 Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?\n",
      "34836 Whoa, she's pretty. (Mentioning the girl on TV)\n",
      "34842 Oh, ok.\n",
      "34853 Oh, are we playing this?!\n",
      "34855 Hey! HowÂ’d the audition go?\n",
      "34860 So it did go well.\n",
      "34863 Oh thatÂ’s great!\n",
      "34865 Oh my God!\n",
      "34869 Oh-oh, what are you doing?\n",
      "34872 Well, it is overdue.\n",
      "34876 (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!\n",
      "34910 Oh come on guys, itÂ’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it werenÂ’t for (struggles to get this out) MonicaÂ’s allergies. (The duck quacks.) YouÂ’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. (The phone rings.) Should I get that? (Laughs, then answers the phone.) Hello? (Listens) Uh no, JoeyÂ’s not here right now. Can I take a message? (Listens) Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (Listens) Okay great. (Listens.) Bye. (Hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle on the door but Monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)\n",
      "34912 (looks down at his clothes) Am I naked again?!\n",
      "34914 Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?\n",
      "34916 Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)\n",
      "34918 As crazy as soccer?\n",
      "34920 You mean you didnÂ’t get it from this?\n",
      "34922 Well, maybe we can fix it yÂ’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!\n",
      "34924 I messed up. Okay? IÂ’m sorry, I really messed up.\n",
      "34926 Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodyÂ’s allowed one mistake, right?\n",
      "34927 You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!\n",
      "34929 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]\n",
      "34931 I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that... [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!\n",
      "34932 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and\n",
      "34934 No! No! No! I just kissed her.\n",
      "34936 How is that worse?!\n",
      "34938 YouÂ’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.\n",
      "34940 Look, IÂ’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youÂ’re not perfect! YouÂ’ve made some errors in judgment too!\n",
      "34942 (lets him out) What happened?!!\n",
      "34944 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!\n",
      "34946 So--You got in voluntarily?!\n",
      "34948 BEND OVER?!!!\n",
      "34949 Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.\n",
      "34951 ...And what did you bring?\n",
      "34953 Janice?\n",
      "34954 Janice?!\n",
      "34956 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.\n",
      "34959 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...\n",
      "34961 Cupping.\n",
      "34965 I canÂ’t believe I did this! What an idiot!\n",
      "34967 Do you think heÂ’ll ever forgive me?\n",
      "34969 YÂ’know what? I-I kinda have.\n",
      "34972 You didnÂ’t see how mad he was, yÂ’know?\n",
      "34984 (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!\n",
      "35002 Oh my God!\n",
      "35005 Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, JoeyÂ’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) HeÂ’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, thatÂ’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, thatÂ’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what heÂ’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.\n",
      "35007 Please tell me you got the message!\n",
      "35009 The actor playing Mac couldnÂ’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 oÂ’clock.\n",
      "35011 Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to RossÂ’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!\n",
      "35013 Sorry! I-I-I donÂ’t know what to say.\n",
      "35015 (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!\n",
      "35017 YÂ’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!\n",
      "35019 Well thatÂ’s good. Because you didnÂ’t! And IÂ’m incredibly happy for ya!!\n",
      "35021 Oh, we could do this all day.\n",
      "35023 You are gonna be a huge star! IÂ’m gonna hug ya!\n",
      "35025 All right!\n",
      "35027 I think so. Yeah, get off me.\n",
      "35044 Okay.\n",
      "35046 (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)\n",
      "35051 Hey!!\n",
      "35053 Oh thatÂ’s right. ItÂ’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?\n",
      "35059 Are you judging them by their covers? Because youÂ’re really not supposed to do that.\n",
      "35064 Hey!\n",
      "35072 Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂ’re not ElizabethÂ’s dad?!\n",
      "35118 Ross!\n",
      "35123 ThereÂ’s a Mr. Bing!\n",
      "35135 But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny storyÂ…",
      " (He starts laughing then notices that Paul isnÂ’t happy.) YouÂ’re roommate in college died didnÂ’t he?\n",
      "35138 Yes, we were just\n",
      "35142 Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.\n",
      "35144 No, the little girl creeps me out.\n",
      "35146 Why would the baby creep me out?\n",
      "35149 This is going in your book?\n",
      "35175 Hey!\n",
      "35179 Damn those robots, theyÂ’re supposed to be our faithful servants!\n",
      "35219 So do you think uh, JoeyÂ’s more charming than me?\n",
      "35221 Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)\n",
      "35225 Who?\n",
      "35228 Hmm.\n",
      "35230 Oh.\n",
      "35233 Oh-oh.\n",
      "35258 We said seven!\n",
      "35260 The only way that I said six would be if the sevenÂ’s, let meet at seven, not at six.\n",
      "35263 Oh my good God.\n",
      "35266 What?!\n",
      "35270 (disgusted) What does it say?!\n",
      "35272 Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.\n",
      "35274 (To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (HeÂ’s wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)\n",
      "35276 So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!\n",
      "35281 Oh IÂ’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?\n",
      "35285 Hi, how are ya?\n",
      "35288 (whispering in JoeyÂ’s ear) The reason he just said.\n",
      "35295 Yeah, IÂ’ve been there my friend.\n",
      "35323 Hey!\n",
      "35329 IÂ’ll give up my ticket.\n",
      "35332 And I think Ross is generous too.\n",
      "35340 Hey!\n",
      "35351 Ross.\n",
      "35440 (on machine) YouÂ’ve reached Monica and ChandlerÂ’s, if youÂ’re listening to this message, weÂ’re probably screening. (to himself) Yeah we are.\n",
      "35442 (on phone) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (Listens) Yes, the groomÂ—No! Not the groom!!\n",
      "35486 (gets up) See you later. (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "35488 (angrily) Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! (He storms out.)\n",
      "35493 (on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)\n",
      "35553 IÂ’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)\n",
      "35555 Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)\n",
      "35557 Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!\n",
      "35559 Okay.\n",
      "35561 Yes, if it really doesnÂ’t mean anything, because you know that IÂ’m just not ready\n",
      "35563 Okay. (They hug.)\n",
      "35566 Totally.\n",
      "35568 Yeah, itÂ’s beautiful.\n",
      "35570 I know.\n",
      "35578 Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I canÂ’t figure this out! ItÂ’s so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aÂ—ah-ah! Paper cut!\n",
      "35580 No, I donÂ’t want to tell anybody else because I donÂ’t want Monica to find out.\n",
      "35582 Well, itÂ’s because I trust you, youÂ’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.\n",
      "35584 Me too.\n",
      "35586 Hey.\n",
      "35588 Oh all right.\n",
      "35591 Oh well, we donÂ’t because we gotÂ…",
      "theÂ…",
      "other pl-place.\n",
      "35662 Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weÂ’ve been too and I canÂ’t find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) ItÂ’s a beautiful selection. (The jeweler walks away slowly.)\n",
      "35664 YÂ’know, IÂ’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.\n",
      "35666 Yeah, IÂ’m gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this oneÂ’s nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?\n",
      "35669 Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.\n",
      "35672 Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youÂ…",
      "hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?\n",
      "35674 (choking up) Oh my God thatÂ’s it, thatÂ’s the ring! How much is it?\n",
      "35679 Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.\n",
      "35683 Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, IÂ’ll go get it. You guard the ring.\n",
      "35716 No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)\n",
      "35718 No, did he hug you?!\n",
      "35720 Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.\n",
      "35722 Yeah?\n",
      "35724 IÂ’m a little busy here Paul.\n",
      "35726 Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)\n",
      "35728 Okay! (Pushes him away.)\n",
      "35732 Do you have my credit card?\n",
      "35734 Thank God! (Grabs his card.)\n",
      "35736 Oh, I canÂ’t go.\n",
      "35739 Oh, thatÂ’s uh, thatÂ’s pretty nice but IÂ’m gonna go with the one I picked first.\n",
      "35741 What?\n",
      "35743 They put you in jail?\n",
      "35745 Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!\n",
      "35747 Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.\n",
      "35749 It was the ring!\n",
      "35780 I canÂ’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!\n",
      "35782 No, itÂ’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see MonicaÂ’s face when I gave it to her, yÂ’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing IÂ’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure itÂ’s perfect.\n",
      "35784 I canÂ’t do that.\n",
      "35787 Okay and he hasnÂ’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.\n",
      "35789 Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.\n",
      "35797 (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youÂ’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, IÂ’m gonna need to have that back. (The guy isnÂ’t sure.) But, in exchange IÂ’m willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.\n",
      "35800 No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You donÂ’t want to break her heart now do you?\n",
      "35803 Yeah, sheÂ’s dyingÂ…",
      " Of a cough apparently.\n",
      "35805 (interrupting her) Okay, thatÂ’s enough honey!\n",
      "35807 Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)\n",
      "35809 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and heÂ’s horrified.) Hey! IÂ’m marrying a dead woman!\n",
      "35810 Guys? (They ignore him.) IÂ’ve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) IÂ’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.\n",
      "35813 Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)\n",
      "35816 Yep, pretty much.\n",
      "35819 (goes to hug him and stops short) HeyyyyÂ—What?\n",
      "35821 Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait Â‘til uh, it was official yÂ’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youÂ’re my best friends.\n",
      "35824 IÂ’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.\n",
      "35826 I know.\n",
      "35828 Check out the ring.\n",
      "35836 Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? (Ross and Joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on TV.) Guys? Guys? (Walks in front of them again.)\n",
      "35841 Okay, well tonightÂ’s the big night.\n",
      "35844 It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. IÂ’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast IÂ’m just gonna propose.\n",
      "35847 Yeah.\n",
      "35849 IÂ’m not gonna mess it up.\n",
      "35851 SheÂ’s not gonna say no.\n",
      "35855 Hey!\n",
      "35857 (To Phoebe) Give me it!\n",
      "35859 Phoebe!\n",
      "35861 (with his mouthful) Hi Monica.\n",
      "35864 Hey!\n",
      "35867 (glaring at her) Well, Monica and Chandler canÂ’t go. WeÂ’re going to dinner remember?!\n",
      "35870 I just get mad when Rachel doesnÂ’t remember where weÂ’re going.\n",
      "35877 Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.\n",
      "35882 Oh, so youÂ’re already doing your part for the kids.\n",
      "35885 Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnÂ’t agree to that!\n",
      "35894 Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) WhatÂ’s going on little elves?\n",
      "35897 Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?\n",
      "35899 Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and sheÂ’s gonna know.\n",
      "35902 (To Monica) You are beautiful.\n",
      "35962 (trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (ItÂ’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.) The champagne is here. (The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)\n",
      "35964 Yes! Yes! IÂ’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everythingÂ—are youÂ—are you perrr-perfect?!\n",
      "35966 Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you canÂ’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you shouldÂ’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?\n",
      "35968 Yes! IÂ’m fine. In fact IÂ’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.\n",

      "35972 (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.\n",
      "35974 What?! IÂ’m Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, thatÂ’s Richard!\n",
      "35977 Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I donÂ’t know why I did that!\n",
      "35982 (to RichardÂ’s date) And uh, you donÂ’t have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) IÂ’m Chandler; I make jokes when IÂ’m uncomfortable.\n",
      "35983 Hi.\n",
      "35985 Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.\n",
      "35987 Yeah, IÂ’ll sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)\n",
      "35991 Yes. (Thinking heÂ’s gone.)\n",
      "36027 I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.\n",
      "36030 What?!\n",
      "36032 (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!\n",
      "36034 Richard!\n",
      "36036 Oh you knew that. Good!\n",
      "36046 For camp!\n",
      "36052 Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youÂ’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!\n",
      "36093 (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!\n",
      "36095 Richard was there so I couldnÂ’t do it!\n",
      "36097 IÂ’m gonna do it tomorrow yÂ’know, and-and surprise her, but now youÂ’ve ruined it!\n",
      "36099 Who walks into a room and asks to see a personÂ’s hands?!\n",
      "36103 This is terrible. What am I going to do?\n",
      "36105 ThatÂ’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.\n",
      "36107 I can do that, IÂ’ve had 30 years of practice.\n",
      "36119 Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnÂ’t want to get married?\n",
      "36123 Hey!\n",
      "36125 Oh, just hanging out, talkinÂ’ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.\n",
      "36128 Yeah, wellÂ…",
      " YÂ’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?\n",
      "36130 Eh\n",
      "36174 Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. LetÂ’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs donÂ’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thatÂ’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig thatÂ’s good at sports!\n",
      "36176 If marriage worked, IÂ’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.\n",
      "36178 Well, never say never but yÂ’know probably uh yeah, never.\n",
      "36180 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why donÂ’t you put down your copy of Â‘The RulesÂ’ huh mantrap?!\n",
      "36182 (to them) ItÂ’s okay, I got a plan.\n",
      "36252 I was making a coconut phone with the professor.\n",
      "36254 What?!\n",
      "36256 MyÂ—Oh my God!\n",
      "36258 HeÂ’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! IÂ’m supposed to do that!\n",
      "36260 Well whatÂ…",
      " YÂ’know what IÂ’m gonna do? IÂ’m gonna go over there; IÂ’m gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!\n",
      "36262 YouÂ’re right.\n",
      "36264 Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) IÂ’m gonna get the ring! IÂ’m gonna get the ring! (Does so) IÂ’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) IÂ’m just going to propose!\n",
      "36266 Okay great.\n",
      "36268 What?!\n",
      "36340 Where is she? IÂ’m not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)\n",
      "36342 (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!\n",
      "36344 Well where did she go?\n",
      "36346 Oh my God, I canÂ’t believe this! YÂ’know, I thoughtÂ…",
      "I thought you were a good guy.\n",
      "36348 Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnÂ’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?\n",
      "36350 YÂ’know what? I canÂ’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!\n",
      "36352 And what does she have to think about? I love her!\n",
      "36354 But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yÂ’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, sheÂ’d be surprised!\n",
      "36356 It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isnÂ’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.\n",
      "36358 Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?\n",
      "36360 YÂ’know RichardÂ…",
      "you are a good guy.\n",
      "36363 I canÂ’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!\n",
      "36365 What?\n",
      "36367 What are you talking about?\n",
      "36369 Well why didnÂ’t you stop her?! Why didnÂ’t you just tell her it was a plan?!\n",
      "36371 Well whereÂ…",
      " Where did she go?\n",
      "36373 I canÂ’t believe I ruined this.\n",
      "36376 Oh my God.\n",
      "36378 Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thoughtÂ…",
      " (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youÂ’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?\n",

      "36845 Yeah, IÂ’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatÂ’s what weÂ’re gonna do.\n",

      "36853 Well, stuff like whereÂ’d we live, yÂ’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. YÂ’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on itÂ’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.

      "36956 DonÂ’t worry about it Pheebs.\n",
      "36959 An old cookie?\n",

      "37003 Daddy. All right look, hereÂ’s the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and thatÂ’s when in happened.\n",
      "37004 Guys?\n",
      "37008 I know.\n",
      "37010 Why do they put so much steam in there?!\n",

      "37014 Not that big a deal? ThereÂ…",
      "there was touching of things.\n",
      "37017 I donÂ’t want him to tell this story for years.\n",
      "37023 If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!\n",
      "37025 (getting up) All right, IÂ’m off to see your dad.\n",
      "37028 Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceÂ—And by face I donÂ’t mean his lap. And by face, I donÂ’t mean my ass. (Exits.)\n",
      "37119 So you understand, IÂ’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didnÂ’t tell people what happened. YÂ’know, IÂ’m a littleÂ…",
      "IÂ’m a little embarrassed about it.\n",
      "37121 What did you do when they found out?\n",
      "37123 So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!\n",
      "37144 ItÂ’s your mommy. ItÂ’s your mommy.\n",
      "37150 That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.\n",
      "37158 And say nothing?\n",
      "37210 No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)\n",
      "37213 Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?\n",
      "37215 Secret? Married people arenÂ’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.\n",
      "37217 No IÂ’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.\n",
      "37219 Oh no-no, I canÂ’t do that.\n",
      "37221 Okay.\n",
      "37223 So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, weÂ’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.\n",
      "37225 No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was PhoebeÂ’s secret?\n",
      "37227 ThatÂ’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?\n",
      "37230 (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!\n",
      "37232 What about him?\n",
      "37238 Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! DonÂ’t show this to Monica! And donÂ’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!\n",
      "37270 Hey.\n",
      "37272 Oh itÂ’s always nicer to here than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"\n",

      "37285 No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!\n",
      "37293 Nancy ThompsonÂ’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)\n",
      "37297 I had too okay?! WeÂ’re getting married! Married couples canÂ’t keep secrets from one another!\n",
      "37299 Du-ude!\n",
      "37302 Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"\n",
      "37305 In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.\n",
      "37307 Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?\n",
      "37319 You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!\n",
      "37321 Ross came in forth and cried!\n",
      "37329 (To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) WowÂ—whoa!\n",
      "37331 Hey!!!\n",
      "37334 That was you!\n",
      "37374 (To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?\n",
      "37376 Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)\n",
      "37378 YÂ’know when I said that because weÂ’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?\n",
      "37380 Yeah that was stupid. LetÂ’s not do that.\n",
      "37387 Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnÂ’t hang out withÂ…",

      "37414 No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whoÂ’s going like thisÂ…",
      " (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)\n",
      "37416 I donÂ’t know what it is, I just canÂ’t take a good picture.\n",
      "37418 Yeah, IÂ’m not in that.\n",
      "37424 All right, but I should warn you, IÂ’m not going. IÂ’m going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)\n",
      "37426 How about those three pointers?\n",
      "37428 And those guys were this (Doing the standard \"This Close\" gesture) close to lettinÂ’ us play this time too.\n",
      "37431 Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.\n",
      "37438 They have that on the napkins at the club.\n",
      "37442 Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yÂ’know you canÂ’t date him right?\n",
      "37449 Dude that is so sad.\n",
      "37451 Could I play?\n",
      "37472 Okay. (Does The Face.)\n",
      "37474 No, I am.\n",

      "37478 Okay. (YouÂ’ll have to see it, I canÂ’t describe the face he makes, but it isnÂ’t good.)\n",
      "37499 Aww! (Smiles.)\n",
      "37503 Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?\n",
      "37564 I canÂ’t help it!\n",
      "37566 Borrow money from me?\n",
      "37568 Why is there jelly on your shoe?\n",
      "37572 Hey!\n",
      "37579 (Pause) IÂ’m right here!\n",
      "37582 IÂ’m still right here!\n",
      "37587 Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?\n",
      "37589 Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)\n",
      "37601 There I am!\n",
      "37603 Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.\n",
      "37605 Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!\n",
      "37607 I donÂ’t know, but donÂ’t worry, donÂ’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look downÂ…",
      " (He falls asleep.)\n",
      "37609 (awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)\n",
      "37678 Ahhh.\n",
      "37680 Oh yeah, that looks good.\n",
      "37684 Okay.\n",
      "37687 IÂ’m marrying her.\n",
      "37712 Die Hard still great!\n",
      "37714 WhatÂ’d you rent?\n",
      "37716 (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.\n",
      "37722 Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.\n",
      "37724 No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.\n",
      "37756 ThatÂ’s sweet.\n",
      "37758 So uh, what did this woman look like?\n",
      "37760 Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?\n",
      "37762 No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractiveÂ…",
      " (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.\n",
      "37764 Well, letÂ’s seeÂ…",
      " (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)\n",
      "37766 Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.\n",
      "37768 (pause) No, weÂ’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.\n",
      "37770 Well, Â‘cause she came back the third summer and sheÂ’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow\n",
      "37772 I did not say fat! I said, \"Fa-aa-aw-owÂ…",
      "\"\n",
      "37774 Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?\n",
      "37776 Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.\n",
      "37817 Can you figure out what IÂ’m doing?\n",
      "37819 Who?\n",
      "37821 Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!\n",
      "37823 What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.\n",
      "37825 Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!\n",
      "37862 (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.\n",
      "37864 (To Monica) ItÂ’s a nickname, IÂ’ll explain later.\n",
      "37866 Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.\n",
      "37868 You-you-you didnÂ’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!\n",
      "37884 As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that IÂ’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.\n",
      "37886 I would really love it if could do both.\n",
      "37888 What?\n",
      "37890 What?!\n",
      "37892 A hundred and forty-five pounds.\n",
      "37894 Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!\n",
      "37896 Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.\n",
      "37898 You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!\n",
      "37900 Look you have to realize I donÂ’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youÂ’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.\n",
      "37902 So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.\n",
      "37904 IÂ’d carry you around in my pocket.\n",
      "37906 SkidmarkÂ’s still got a way with the ladies.\n",
      "37954 Come on! Why are we here?!\n",
      "37956 The hot chicks?\n",
      "37958 Wow thatÂ’s actually pretty cool.\n",
      "37960 Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.\n",
      "37963 You didnÂ’t bring me here to do that, did you?\n",
      "37973 OHÂ…",
      "MYÂ…",
      "GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnÂ’t tell her we were getting married, did you?\n",
      "37975 Did she freak out?\n",
      "37977 Right.\n",
      "37979 (laughs) You said no right?\n",
      "37981 You said no right?!\n",
      "37983 Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkÂ’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canÂ’t wait to read your book Ross!!\n",
      "37985 What do you think sheÂ’s just gonna sit there quietly? You donÂ’t think sheÂ’s gonna want to make a toast? You donÂ’t think sheÂ’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!\n",
      "37987 YÂ’know what? ItÂ’s gonna be okay. YÂ’know what? SheÂ’s probably not gonna even want to come.\n",
      "37989 No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?\n",
      "37991 Yes!!\n",
      "37993 Yes!!!\n",
      "38082 Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itÂ’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! WeÂ’re not even sure why weÂ’re having it.\n",
      "38152 I say we go with Careless Whisper.\n",
      "38154 (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?\n",
      "38159 ArenÂ’t you just a tinsy bit curious?\n",
      "38164 No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!\n",
      "38166 Is that what youÂ’re thinking about right now?\n",
      "38169 Janice, IÂ’m sorry but umm, you canÂ’t stay here tonight.\n",
      "38171 Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.\n",
      "38177 Say again?\n",
      "38179 Feelings, such strong feelings.\n",
      "38183 I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)\n",
      "38185 No, no, no. No-no-no.\n",
      "38187 No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.\n",
      "38189 Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).\n",
      "38193 Oh, okay, time's up!\n",
      "38195 Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?\n",
      "38197 Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inÂ…",
      "vegetables, Joey?\n",
      "38202 Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.\n",
      "38211 Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)\n",
      "38213 Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)\n",
      "38217 I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!\n",
      "38219 Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.\n",
      "38221 Okay, but if you can'tÂ…",
      "no dinner!\n",
      "38229 Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.\n",
      "38238 I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.\n",
      "38240 Which smells delicious!\n",
      "38242 What?\n",
      "38248 Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!\n",
      "38261 Huh! Where is the dog?!\n",
      "38266 Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!\n",
      "38268 What is it doing here?\n",
      "38271 Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!\n",
      "38273 (gasping) Really?\n",
      "38275 Well, it still has to go, right?\n",
      "38276 Okay, it's um\n",
      "38279 (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, \"Do what you have to do\") Okay, I hate dogs.\n",
      "38285 They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.\n",
      "38288 (scared) Is there a puppy here?\n",
      "38290 (to Tag) Okay, you are new!\n",
      "38294 Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "38296 And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!\n",
      "38362 (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.\n",
      "38364 How did youÂ…",
      "know? (Heads back into the bathroom)\n",
      "38371 (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?\n",
      "38373 Why not?\n",
      "38375 Well, I, I should go in there.\n",
      "38377 Why not?\n",
      "38379 This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)\n",
      "38382 Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.\n",
      "38384 Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?\n",
      "38386 And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)\n",
      "38395 No, no he went for a walk.\n",
      "38402 Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.\n",
      "38405 Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. YÂ’know, for you, andÂ…",
      "(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)\n",
      "38408 Clunkers?! Oh my god!\n",
      "38411 (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!\n",
      "38414 It's up to you.\n",
      "38432 All right.\n",
      "38434 You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.\n",
      "38436 Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)\n",
      "38440 Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)\n",
      "38443 Okay. Okay.\n",
      "38451 That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.\n",
      "38457 Hey! What are you guys doing?\n",
      "38460 IÂ’m sorry, who?\n",
      "38462 But we donÂ’t know the neighbors.\n",
      "38465 WouldnÂ’t it be easier if we just moved?\n",
      "38467 Eh, somebodyÂ’s in a good mood!\n",
      "38490 Well, either that or uhÂ…",
      "(Motions towards JoeyÂ’s door.)\n",
      "38513 (about to cry) Am not!\n",
      "38515 DonÂ’t worry, IÂ’m brave! I am brave! IÂ…",
      "I am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?\n",
      "38520 (laughs) 4:00 A.M.\n",
      "38522 I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.\n",
      "38527 Mm! Night GarÂ’! (Monica closes the door.)\n",
      "38539 Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!\n",
      "38547 Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?\n",
      "38554 (with his mouth full) What happened? IÂ’m just eating candy.\n",
      "38556 Absolutely! YÂ’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.\n",
      "38562 What is the matter with you?\n",
      "38573 Maybe, isnÂ’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?\n",
      "38578 YÂ’know what would work?\n",
      "38580 Stop making candy!\n",
      "38582 You mean they like you.\n",
      "38584 Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?\n",
      "38665 (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?\n",
      "38668 Joey!\n",
      "38670 What are you doing?\n",
      "38672 Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.\n",
      "38675 All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and IÂ’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?\n",
      "38677 No not (imitating) Candy Lady.\n",
      "38679 All right, yÂ’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! YouÂ’ve ruined it! Go home! YouÂ’ve ruined it! YouÂ’ve ruined it!\n",
      "38682 YouÂ’re welcome. (They kiss.)\n",
      "38684 No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uhÂ—are you okay?\n",
      "38690 Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at MichelleÂ’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.\n",
      "38692 betrothed couple.\n",
      "38694 Hey!\n",
      "38696 Pheebs?\n",
      "38698 Skull?\n",
      "38715 How long have we been home?\n",
      "38717 Lovely!\n",
      "38718 Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?\n",
      "38720 Why not?\n",
      "38723 Hey!\n",
      "38728 Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?\n",
      "38730 Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.\n",
      "38732 No reason, exceptÂ…",
      "sheÂ…",
      "toldÂ…",
      "me.\n",
      "38734 No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.\n",
      "38739 Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?\n",
      "38744 (to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)\n",
      "38747 Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.\n",
      "38749 Is this because of the burrito thing?\n",
      "38751 Give him money? It was a joke!\n",
      "38753 Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.\n",
      "38755 Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)\n",
      "38757 Okay. (Walks back to Monica)\n",
      "38759 Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)\n",
      "38782 How do you know so much about this?\n",
      "38784 Richard used to do it, didn't he?\n",
      "38786 Mustached bastard\n",
      "38788 (walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...\n",
      "38790 (finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)\n",
      "38796 Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up the coins. Chandler thinks, Joey is just helping him to pick them up.) Thank you.\n",
      "38800 Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "38802 If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?\n",
      "38860 (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\n",
      "38862 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)\n",
      "38864 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdÂ…",
      "turtle-man?\n",
      "38866 What?\n",
      "38868 You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben is standing right there) Ho, ho, ho!\n",
      "38871 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\n",
      "38873 Why?\n",
      "38875 But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\n",
      "38877 Fine, I'll give the suit back.\n",
      "38879 Santa? Really?\n",
      "38881 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\n",
      "38883 Then it's okay! (They kiss.)\n",
      "38886 Because, if Santa and the HolidayÂ…",
      "Armadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "38889 Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?\n",
      "38924 My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey whoÂ’s nodding.)\n",
      "38938 Ohh. Mmm.\n",
      "38940 Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.\n",
      "38942 (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.\n",
      "38944 IÂ—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.\n",
      "38946 Because it's too delicious.\n",
      "38948 No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) MommaÂ’s Little Bakery. (Pause) I feel terrible, IÂ’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.\n",
      "38951 So\n",
      "38956 Oh, whatÂ’s at 8:00?\n",
      "38966 Well, maybe since the age of 9, FrannieÂ’s made some new friends.\n",
      "38970 I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes him.)\n",
      "38991 Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!\n",
      "38993 I canÂ’t seem to say goodbye.\n",
      "38995 Well IÂ’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!\n",
      "38997 (closing the box) YÂ’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.\n",
      "38999 Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?\n",
      "39025 Well, thank you for lunch.\n",
      "39027 So apparently we just donÂ’t pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?\n",
      "39029 Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)\n",
      "39031 By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We donÂ’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.\n",
      "39033 Well, we donÂ’t want that.\n",
      "39035 But we should take it.\n",
      "39037 Why?\n",
      "39039 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)\n",
      "39075 IÂ’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, IÂ’ll regret it.\n",
      "39080 What are you doing tonight?\n",
      "39082 Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)\n"

      "39148 Oh yes!\n",
      "39150 Oh yes!\n",
      "39152 Oh yes! Oh yes!\n",
      "39154 Well thatÂ’s not fair, youÂ’ve already had some!\n",
      "39156 What do we use to split it?\n",
      "39158 (examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. UhÂ…",
      " ThereÂ’s more crust on this side. YÂ’know? So, maybe if I measured\n",
      "39160 All right, IÂ’ll pick that one. (Points.)\n",
      "39162 (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!\n",
      "39164 Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and donÂ’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat myÂ…",
      " (Rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. That process leaves just the forkful Chandler has, Rachel starts to go after that little bit and Chandler retreats into his apartment.)\n",
      "39198 Stick to your side!\n",
      "39213 (looking up with her) ThatÂ’s a plane!\n",
      "39224 (with a quivering voice) No, IÂ’m not!\n",
      "39226 Because itÂ’s flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)\n",
      "39247 (whispering) Monica!\n",
      "39249 I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?\n",
      "39251 Sorry, I justÂ…",
      "canÂ’t sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover IÂ’m likeÂ…",
      "(Fake snores.)\n",
      "39253 What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)\n",
      "39263 Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) IÂ’m sorry, I thought maybe IÂ’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.\n",
      "39265 It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!\n",
      "39267 Hey, yÂ’know what we can do? YÂ’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yÂ’know like we did when we were first going out. ItÂ’d be fun!\n",
      "39269 Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?\n",
      "39271 (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.\n",
      "39273 ThatÂ’s correct.\n",
      "39308 (startled) What? What? What?\n",
      "39323 Yeah! You?\n",
      "39325 (intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youÂ’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.\n",
      "39332 Do you know what just happened?\n",
      "39334 No. We were in the middle of sexÂ…",
      "and you fell asleep.\n",
      "39336 (turning the light back on) Monica?\n",
      "39338 I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!\n",
      "39340 Okay.\n",
      "39342 Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! DonÂ’t fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnÂ’t move as he gets out of bed and as heÂ’s heading for the door.) And I probably wonÂ’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.\n",
      "39396 Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I canÂ’t believe that IÂ’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.\n",
      "39398 Well, youÂ’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes\n",
      "39400 Do you wanna?\n",
      "39422 CouldnÂ’t I just say, \"This is Ross?\"\n",
      "39433 (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)\n",
      "39476 Joey! Joe! (Sees that heÂ’s not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) BeerÂ’s still cold. Something terrible mustÂ’ve happened here! (He decides itÂ’s not that important; sits down on Rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (Runs over to Stevie.) Stevie, I was never here! (Runs out.)\n",
      "39523 My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)\n",
      "39613 Hey!\n",
      "39615 Yeah, IÂ’d love to but IÂ’ve tried that so many times they wonÂ’t even let me in the store anymore.\n",
      "39617 (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?\n",
      "39619 ThatÂ’s awesome! ThatÂ’s great! What made you do it?!\n",
      "39621 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke JoeyÂ’s chair?\n",
      "39623 I thought I broke JoeyÂ’s chair! ThatÂ’s why I replaced it with mine!\n",
      "39625 Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?\n",
      "39627 IÂ’m gettinÂ’ my chair back! (Heads for Joey and RachelÂ’s.)\n",
      "39630 Joey you broke my chair!!\n",
      "39637 I think I should get the chair!\n",
      "39639 Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnÂ’t broke a chair, is me!\n",
      "39641 Well, whereÂ’s the logic in that?!\n",
      "39643 So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!\n",
      "39645 What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!\n",
      "39712 (To Monica) SheÂ’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.\n",
      "39727 No Rach, itÂ’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnÂ’t that much fun.\n",
      "39742 Ross, a sports car? WouldnÂ’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?\n",
      "39761 (To Joey) Would you put that back on?! MonicaÂ’s gonna be here any minute!\n",
      "39763 (frustrated) Okay, for the last time. ItÂ’s not named for each individual man.\n",
      "39765 Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I canÂ’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I canÂ’t believe that you would have a tux thatÂ’s thirty years old! (Puts his hand on Mr. GellerÂ’s shoulder.)\n",
      "39767 Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)\n",
      "39769 Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)\n",
      "39771 (getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out whatÂ’s going on.\n",
      "39773 Hey-hey are you drunk?\n",
      "39775 Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!\n",
      "39777 Yes!\n",
      "39779 Yes!!\n",
      "39781 Okay, hereÂ’s the thing. WeÂ’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youÂ’re drunk.\n",
      "39783 Yeah, IÂ’ll take care of it.\n",
      "39785 (laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.\n",
      "39787 ThatÂ’s still yours. Okay, now remember itÂ’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.\n",
      "39789 Okay.\n",
      "39824 Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.\n",
      "39826 See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whoÂ’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller whoÂ’s standing next to him.)\n",
      "39830 (correcting her) Phil.\n",
      "39832 Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) youÂ’re doing great. YouÂ’re doing great. YouÂ’re doing fine.\n",
      "39834 MonicaÂ’s a little drunk.\n",
      "39837 (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnÂ’t want her parents to know sheÂ’s drunk.\n",
      "39840 MonicaÂ’s wasted.\n",
      "39842 (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!\n",
      "39851 Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!\n",
      "39854 For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!\n",
      "39856 No-no-no-no! That was the joke!\n",
      "39858 No, because youÂ’re not a grandmother!\n",
      "39876 (to a waiter) Oh thatÂ’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.\n",
      "39878 (To Monica) How are you feeling?\n",
      "39881 (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and donÂ’t talk to anyone.\n",
      "39883 Pheebs!!\n",
      "39890 I think itÂ’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)\n",
      "39908 What?\n",
      "39917 Okay, here we go.\n",
      "39944 Hey! HowÂ’d it go?\n",
      "39948 Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.\n",
      "39963 (To Ross) Monica said wedding.\n",
      "39966 Do you think you could get through a poem?\n",
      "39971 Too?\n",
      "39975 Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)\n",
      "39982 ThatÂ’s great!\n",
      "39984 So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!\n",
      "40000 DonÂ’t do it.\n",
      "40071 I think itÂ’s the dying cat parade.\n",
      "40073 (turning around and looking) Oh my God!\n",
      "40075 YÂ’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \"YouÂ’re half Scottish right?\"\n",
      "40077 Yes!!\n",
      "40079 Why is your family Ross?!\n",
      "40081 If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.\n",
      "40133 Well, I feel like a snack!\n",
      "40135 Oh no thanks. I donÂ’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.\n",
      "40137 Well itÂ’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland byÂ…",
      "Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)\n",
      "40143 We heard you play all the way from your apartment!\n",
      "40145 ThatÂ’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just donÂ’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.\n",
      "40147 Because we hate them.\n",
      "40149 We have heard you play.\n",
      "40313 You mean the spitter?\n",
      "40315 Easy for you to say; youÂ’ll be wearing a veil.\n",
      "40317 You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?\n",
      "40319 Sorry, I just donÂ’t like the idea of when I say, \"I do,\" heÂ’s thinking, \"Yeah, IÂ’d do her too!\"\n",
      "40321 Yeah!\n",
      "40331 Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.\n",
      "40333 We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!\n",
      "40352 No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.\n",
      "40355 Joe\n",
      "40361 (To Monica) YÂ’know, we havenÂ’t found anybody else.\n",
      "40364 Yeah you can do it.\n",
      "40366 Yeah.\n",
      "40401 Hey!\n",
      "40403 Hey!\n",
      "40406 Our minister\n",
      "40411 Okay.\n",
      "40414 (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?\n",
      "40444 Yeah. O-okay.\n",
      "40448 See Joe, not that thatÂ’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! YÂ’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!\n",
      "40450 No, not usÂ…",
      " (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)\n",
      "40455 See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yÂ’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.\n",
      "40459 Joe?\n",
      "40461 IsnÂ’t that what happened with you and the brideÂ’s maid?\n",
      "40467 And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.\n",
      "40469 But then later that night\n",
      "40471 (answering the door) Hey!\n",
      "40473 Well I wasÂ…",
      " I was exactly expecting company afterÂ…",
      "(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.\n",
      "40475 Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brideÂ’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youÂ’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?\n",
      "40477 Well, look itÂ’s been a really emotional time yÂ’know, and youÂ’ve had a lot to drink. And youÂ’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!\n",
      "40479 You kidding? YouÂ’re the most beautiful woman in most roomsÂ…",
      " (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! WhatÂ’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\n",
      "40481 But we donÂ’t do that.\n",
      "40483 How drunk are you?\n",
      "40485 (thinks) ThatÂ’s the perfect amount!\n",
      "40488 What?\n",
      "40490 I know.\n",
      "40492 Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?\n",
      "40494 Okay!\n",
      "40496 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\n",
      "40498 Yep!\n",
      "40500 Count of three?\n",
      "40502 Two!\n",
      "40504 Well I think itÂ’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\n",
      "40506 Eh!\n",
      "40507 Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)\n",
      "40509 Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-eÂ…",
      " (Notices that the TV is turned off.)\n",
      "40511 No! No! No!\n",
      "40513 TheyÂ’re in my bag over there. (Points.)\n",
      "40515 Uh, could you leave me one?\n",
      "40517 Yeah.\n",
      "40519 No I-I-IÂ’m fine.\n",
      "40526 What?\n",
      "40528 Who did you originally want to hook up with?\n",
      "40531 (To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?\n",
      "40533 Oh, itÂ’s not important? ItÂ’s not important?! If it wasnÂ’t for a brideÂ’s maid youÂ’d be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!\n",
      "40536 I donÂ’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and IÂ’m runner up.\n",
      "40539 (To Joey) Look there is no way youÂ’re doing this wedding now. Okay?\n",
      "40541 Okay, itÂ’s just weird! Okay? I donÂ’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needÂ…",
      "I donÂ’t know what I need. I need a walk.\n",
      "40543 It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)\n",
      "40581 Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!\n",
      "40583 Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding\n",
      "40585 How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!\n",
      "40587 ThatÂ’s what you should say.\n",
      "40589 When youÂ’re marrying us; thatÂ’s what you should say.\n",
      "40591 IÂ’d love it if you would do it.\n",
      "40593 But those are the words! Those exact words!\n",
      "40615 Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.\n",
      "40633 So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that weÂ’re trying to get to play at the wedding?\n",
      "40635 Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!\n",
      "40637 Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?\n",
      "40639 Do you want me to call?\n",
      "40642 Staying out of the way.\n",
      "40649 Sure! ThatÂ’s one of the great things about being engaged. IÂ’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.\n",
      "40657 (To Ross) Smooth.\n",
      "40746 So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?\n",
      "40748 Huh.\n",
      "40751 Hey!\n",
      "40753 Uh Joe, when itÂ’s one oÂ’clock in the morning and you donÂ’t come by? ThatÂ’s okay!\n",
      "40755 Really? Right across the street?\n",
      "40757 WhenÂ’d you meet her?\n",
      "40759 Excellent! YÂ’know Ross met somebody too!\n",
      "40762 Hi! HowÂ’d it go?\n",
      "40764 (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in RossÂ’s situation?\n",
      "40767 So this is nice! I wish I didnÂ’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, whatÂ’s the name the girl youÂ’re dating?\n",
      "40768 Bye! (Exits.)\n",
      "40822 Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)\n",
      "40825 (returning) What are you guys talking about?\n",
      "40828 But I love swing music!\n",
      "40830 Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And thereÂ’s another reason too.\n",
      "40832 I donÂ’t want to say.\n",
      "40834 Well itÂ’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasÂ…",
      "the first time I knew thatÂ…",
      "you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.\n",
      "40877 Hi, honey! IÂ’m home!\n",
      "40879 Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?\n",
      "40881 YÂ’know itÂ’s funny I started it but, now itÂ’s scary me. So could you come out here please?\n",
      "40883 Oh you got a wedding dress? ThatÂ’s great!\n",
      "40885 Well then why canÂ’t I see it?\n",
      "40887 Okay I promise. IÂ’ll-IÂ’ll hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you lookÂ…",
      "hideous.\n",
      "40889 Yeah, thatÂ’s like the most ugliest dress IÂ’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?\n",
      "40891 Oh thatÂ’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean itÂ’s like yuck! ItÂ’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!\n",
      "40893 Okay!\n",
      "40895 (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.\n",
      "41005 Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.\n",
      "41086 Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big\n",
      "41088 Kinda. TheyÂ’re really big.\n",
      "41090 What?\n",
      "41092 No. No, see when I first meet somebody itÂ’s uh itÂ’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.\n",
      "41094 Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and IÂ’m afraid even more sweating.\n",
      "41096 I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.\n",
      "41098 Well yeah! But now that I know that youÂ’re having these thoughts, IÂ’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh IÂ’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.\n",
      "41100 (hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!\n",
      "41190 Hey!\n",
      "41192 YÂ’know IÂ’m-IÂ’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.\n",
      "41194 YÂ’know I was thinking if we had aÂ…",
      "a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours\n",
      "41196 Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!\n",
      "41198 ThatÂ’s me! Come on!\n",
      "41200 Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.\n",
      "41203 (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!\n",
      "41208 IÂ’ll be right with you.\n",
      "41213 I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. ItÂ’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at MonicaÂ’s eyes.) Say something.\n",
      "41217 Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?\n",
      "41414 This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.\n",
      "41430 YÂ’know I think we should invite them.\n",
      "41432 Well this is just sad!\n",
      "41438 Well, thanks a lot for hookinÂ’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.\n",

      "41442 You mean like for award shows?\n",
      "41444 You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, \"You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!\"\n",
      "41446 Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)\n",
      "41448 Not bad.\n",
      "41450 WhoÂ’s that?\n",
      "41452 Pierce Brosnan?\n",
      "41454 Are you serious?\n",
      "41456 007?! This is James BondÂ’s tux?!\n",
      "41458 Oh, I have to get married in James BondÂ’s tux!\n",
      "41460 Oh, itÂ’s not just that, I would be EnglandÂ’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestyÂ’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?\n",
      "41503 A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?\n",
      "41505 What?\n",
      "41507 You canÂ’t wear that! IÂ’m wearing the famous tux! James BondÂ’s tux!\n",
      "41509 SoÂ—If you wear that youÂ’ll make mine less special.\n",
      "41511 Please, donÂ’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!\n",
      "41513 Look, itÂ’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.\n",
      "41515 That was pretty 007.\n",
      "41544 Ross is Batman!\n",
      "41546 Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!\n",
      "41548 Batman has a utility belt!\n",
      "41550 Batman has the Batmobile!\n",
      "41552 Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?\n",
      "41554 Actually, I donÂ’t like martinis.\n",
      "41556 Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)\n",
      "41584 I would but mine doesnÂ’t fit. The pants are a little tight.\n",
      "41587 Well, does that mean that youÂ’re not going to wearing yours?\n",
      "41589 (standing up) Let me try it on!\n",
      "41591 (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) WhatÂ’s this?\n",
      "41593 An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnÂ’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!\n",
      "41595 The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)\n",
      "41600 Well, youÂ’re welcome. And tell them weÂ’re really glad theyÂ’re coming.\n",
      "41619 (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!\n",
      "41621 Whose is it?\n",
      "41623 Whose is it?\n",
      "41625 Oh, come on! I donÂ’t care! Come on! Whose is it?\n",
      "41628 Do you realize you get louder each week?\n",
      "41630 I figured IÂ’d buy those. Pat, IÂ’d like to buy a vow. (Laughs)\n",
      "41632 Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?\n",
      "41634 Do you happen to know what IÂ’m going to say?\n",
      "41636 (watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! WhatÂ’s wrong with me? Ooh, donÂ’t open that door.\n",
      "41637 (writing) Monica, there are no wordsÂ…",
      " (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!\n",
      "41640 IÂ’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldÂ’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!\n",
      "41651 Yeah, IÂ’m not sure I can do that.\n",
      "41654 (seeing her) Okay.\n",
      "41656 All right, thereÂ’s a nuclear holocaust, IÂ’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?\n",
      "41661 (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) ThatÂ’s one?\n",
      "41663 Oh, yÂ’know-yÂ’know what, I was looking at it upside down.\n",
      "41667 (writing) Monica\n",
      "41669 (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?\n",
      "41673 You'll get one.\n",
      "41675 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\n",
      "41677 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\n",
      "41679 No, no, no.\n",
      "41681 (trapped) Uh, uh.\n",
      "41683 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)\n",
      "41684 Nice try.\n",
      "41686 Look, Monica\n",
      "41688 This is not going to work.\n",
      "41690 You are so great! I love you!\n",
      "41692 Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!\n",
      "41694 No I didn't!\n",
      "41696 No I didn't!\n",
      "41698 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\n",
      "41699 YÂ’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\n",
      "41701 Well, what if all my stuff was here?\n",
      "41703 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂ’m saying?\n",
      "41705 Oh my God.\n",
      "41707 Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thoughtÂ…",
      " (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youÂ’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?\n",
      "41728 I've had a very long, hard day.\n",
      "41730 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.\n",
      "41732 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.\n",
      "41734 Hey Joe!\n",
      "41735 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a CokeÂ—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)Â—Diet Coke.\n",
      "41741 It happened in London.\n",
      "41743 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "41745 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!\n",
      "41749 (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)\n",
      "41777 (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!\n",
      "41779 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?\n",
      "41781 Phoebe knows about us!\n",
      "41788 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!\n",
      "41799 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!\n",
      "41801 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)\n",
      "41811 Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?\n",
      "41813 Oh, you're-you're going?\n",
      "41815 (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.\n",
      "41817 Not if I kiss you first.\n",
      "41819 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\n",
      "41821 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\n",
      "41823 Because I'm in love with Monica!!\n",
      "41825 Love her! That's right, IÂ…",
      "LOVEÂ…",
      "HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.\n",
      "41830 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n",
      "41843 Who are those people?\n",
      "41854 WhatÂ’s going on?\n",
      "41858 So we both finished our vows.\n",
      "41871 DonÂ’t worry honey, weÂ’ll make yours funnier.\n",
      "41872 Okay, what do you guys think?\n",
      "41875 You really like it?\n",
      "41877 I stole MonicaÂ’s and changed the name.\n",
      "41915 Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thatÂ’s because I didnÂ’t send him an invitation.\n",
      "41917 I donÂ’t even know the man. Okay? WeÂ’re not the close. I havenÂ’t seen him in years.\n",
      "41919 Well he doesnÂ’t have to know! ItÂ’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.\n",
      "41921 Trust me, you donÂ’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.\n",
      "41957 WhatÂ’s this?\n",
      "41959 Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersÂ—Think of the money weÂ’ll save!! (Monica just looks at him.) WeÂ’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?\n",
      "41961 YÂ’know we already went over this and I won!\n",
      "41963 Look forget it okay? I donÂ’t want to go. I donÂ’t want to see him. I donÂ’t wanna.\n",
      "41965 No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youÂ’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. YÂ’know itÂ’s hard enough to be fourteen. YouÂ’re skinny. YouÂ’re wearing speedoesÂ—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and thereÂ’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!\n",
      "41967 He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!\n",
      "41969 Does it matter?!\n",
      "41971 Yeah o-okay, but IÂ’m just doing this for you.\n",
      "41973 So I really never get to win anymore?\n",
      "42008 Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)\n",
      "42011 No! No! I donÂ’t want him to know weÂ’re yet! IÂ’m not sure IÂ’m ready for that. And besides heÂ’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.\n",
      "42013 I donÂ’t know if IÂ’ve told you this, but heÂ’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years\n",
      "42015 Yeah, heÂ’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. YÂ’know itÂ’s all very Cats in the CradleÂ—I donÂ’t want to get into it. (The show starts.) Here we go.\n",
      "42017 And thereÂ’s daddy!\n",
      "42064 Believe me, IÂ’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!\n",
      "42066 ThatÂ’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.\n",
      "42068 HeÂ’s coming into the audience. HeÂ’s coming into the audience.\n",
      "42075 It canÂ’t happen like this. Okay? IÂ’ll meet you back at the hotel.\n",
      "42095 (resigning himself to his fate) Chandler. (He quickly sits down.)\n",
      "42097 Oh, theyÂ’re a hoot.\n",
      "42103 Actually Monica and I are engaged.\n",
      "42107 Wait! Wait! WeÂ’d really love it if you could be there.\n",
      "42109 I know it would make me happy, maÂ’am.\n",
      "42112 Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.\n",
      "42115 (To Monica) When I was growing up IÂ…",
      "played the one on the far left.\n",
      "42153 Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.\n",
      "42155 The young hot ball and chain.\n",
      "42163 WhatÂ’s up?\n",
      "42165 Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. IÂ’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.\n",
      "42167 But youÂ’re still my friend?\n",
      "42169 During this timeÂ…",
      "are you, are you still my best man?\n",
      "42171 Do I still call you Ross?\n",
      "42173 (smiling) Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.\n",
      "42175 So are weÂ…",
      "friends again?\n",
      "42177 Okay. (Pause) You wonÂ’t believe what MonicaÂ’s older brother just said to me!\n",
      "42234 (entering from the bedroom) Okay. HereÂ’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.\n",
      "42236 Yes, include more people in this.\n",
      "42238 Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.\n",
      "42240 Well you donÂ’t have to sound so surprised.\n",
      "42242 What?\n",
      "42244 Honestly? Me too.\n",
      "42246 Yeah. YÂ’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and IÂ’ll go allÂ…",
      "Chandler. But nothing has.\n",
      "42248 Okay. IÂ’ll be right there.\n",
      "42251 WeÂ’re the Bings.\n",
      "42253 Mr. and Mrs. Bing! (Walks away.)\n",
      "42258 Hi.\n",
      "42260 Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (SheÂ’s wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)\n",
      "42270 HiÂ…",
      "dad.\n",
      "42277 Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)\n",
      "42471 How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldÂ’ve hid at the gym!\n",
      "42473 Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that IÂ’m related to Monica. How is she?\n",
      "42475 No! No! No! I canÂ’t do that!\n",
      "42477 Because if I go home, weÂ’re gonna become the Bings! I canÂ’t be the Bings!\n",
      "42479 The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!\n",
      "42481 No.\n",
      "42483 ItÂ’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodyÂ’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And IÂ’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I donÂ’t race cars! I donÂ’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.\n",
      "42485 I want to. I love her so much, but IÂ’m afrÂ…",
      "ItÂ’s too huge.\n",
      "42487 Well yeah, but then\n",
      "42489 Depends on what you mean by we.\n",
      "42539 No.\n",
      "42541 Yeah okay. Well, whatÂ’s the next little bit?\n",
      "42543 Yeah. YouÂ’re right. Hey I-I can do that.\n",
      "42545 Okay, excuse me for a minute. (Starts to leave)\n",
      "42547 Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.\n",
      "42549 Okay.\n",
      "42550 Oh fresh air!\n",
      "42595 What?\n",
      "42598 Ross! (He starts to get up.)\n",
      "42600 (standing up) ThatÂ’s right! IÂ’m not!\n",
      "42602 I know about Monica.\n",
      "42605 Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.\n",
      "42607 You donÂ’t know?\n",
      "42610 MonicaÂ’s pregnant.\n",
      "42612 Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes\n",
      "42613 Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thatÂ’s when I uh, saw this. (He holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads I (heart) New York.) Yeah, yÂ’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, canÂ’t be scary.\n",
      "42615 But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so sheÂ’d know I was okay.\n",
      "42620 You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) IÂ’m so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)\n",
      "42622 Are you Joey?\n",
      "42630 You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)\n",
      "42632 Okay.\n",
      "42635 (in MonicaÂ’s ear) HeÂ’s Greek Orthodox.\n",
      "42643 (To Ross) No, thatÂ’s okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way itÂ’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if IÂ’m sure? (He leans in and kisses her.)\n",
      "42645 I do.\n",
      "42651 (To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.\n",
      "42653 Our baby.\n",

      "42657 ThenÂ…",
      "who did?\n",

      "42730 What the fuÂ—(beep)Â—ck are you doing?!\n",
      "42796 What are you guys doing?\n",
      "42816 You see, I donÂ’t sayÂ—(Starts laughing.)\n",

      "42872 WhoÂ’s the father?\n",
      "42876 Why not?\n",
      "42881 As in Barbara StreisandÂ’s husband James Brolin?\n",
      "42885 YÂ’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.\n",
      "42902 Before we go out there IÂ’ve got a present for ya.\n",
      "42904 No?\n",
      "42906 IÂ’ve been taking dancing lessons.\n",
      "42908 Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.\n",
      "42910 So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?\n",
      "42913 I donÂ’t know, itÂ’s these new shoes, theyÂ’re all slippery.\n",
      "42915 Not well.\n",
      "42949 Thank you.\n",
      "42951 Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.\n",
      "42960 Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)\n",
      "42966 What size shoes do you wear?\n",
      "42968 Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?\n",
      "42970 (looking at JoeyÂ’s feet) Those arenÂ’t eleven and a half.\n",
      "43036 And the world will never know.\n",
      "43038 Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.\n",

      "43233 Marriage advice? Really?!\n",
      "43235 I donÂ’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.\n",
      "43237 She picked those out too.\n",
      "43239 That was her.\n",
      "43241 I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?\n",
      "43288 (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?\n",
      "43291 UhhÂ…",
      " Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!\n",
      "43296 Oh yeah. IÂ’ll take, IÂ’ll take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)\n",
      "43298 Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!\n",
      "43309 Why donÂ’t you go up on stage. IÂ’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.\n",
      "43320 Okay, you ready for the last picture?\n",
      "43322 Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)\n",
      "43368 WeÂ’re back!\n",
      "43370 ItÂ’s picture time.\n",
      "43372 (showing her the pictures) HereÂ’s a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thatÂ’s me. (Another one.) And thatÂ’s me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.\n",
      "43374 Eh?\n",
      "43377 Okay, so this isnÂ’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withÂ…",
      "with this lady. Which by the look on your face IÂ’m sure youÂ’ll remember. So we donÂ’t needÂ—(Rips the picture)Â—ThereÂ’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.\n",
      "43379 Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!\n",
      "43381 Call it even?!\n",
      "43398 Hey! Babe! ArenÂ’t you excited weÂ’re going on our honeymoon?\n",
      "43400 (singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama\n",
      "43404 IÂ’d better go pack.\n",
      "43406 A Speedo? Uh, I donÂ’t have a Speedo. IÂ’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)\n",
      "43430 (entering) Hey, what was that all about?\n",
      "43432 (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didnÂ’t even know thatÂ—Why didnÂ’t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!\n",
      "43434 (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.\n",
      "43436 Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.\n",
      "43438 You already know.\n",
      "43480 Oh honey, leave them alone, theyÂ’re in love.\n",
      "43487 We are on our honeymoon.\n",
      "43495 25J and K, any chance those arenÂ’t together?\n",
      "43505 No.\n",
      "43507 Just act like you belong.\n",
      "43509 Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)\n",
      "43511 Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)\n",
      "43513 Oh thatÂ’s all right, I have it memorized. ItÂ’s 1A.\n",
      "43515 Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)\n",
      "43586 Oh youÂ’ve got to be kidding me.\n",
      "43591 WeÂ’re you just ten seconds later!\n",
      "43594 (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.\n",
      "43597 What else is new?\n",
      "43674 Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I canÂ’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.\n",
      "43684 TheyÂ’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.\n",
      "43686 IÂ’m sorry, weÂ’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.\n",
      "43691 Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance\n",
      "43693 We reallyÂ…",
      "didnÂ’t get a chance to\n",
      "43706 Ross! ItÂ’s got your wavy black lines!\n",
      "43733 YÂ’know who has a great video camera?\n",
      "43736 LetÂ’s call Â‘em.\n",
      "43741 Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)\n",
      "43745 What?\n",
      "43750 I donÂ’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.\n",
      "43819 Yeah, weÂ’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)\n",
      "43832 I still donÂ’t get it, we didnÂ’t do anything wrong.\n",
      "43834 I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!\n",
      "43836 Well maybe it was all of your questions.\n",
      "43838 The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!\n",
      "43840 (angrily) Was that another question?\n",
      "43874 Did you do it on our invitations?!\n",
      "43876 So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)\n",
      "43895 ThatÂ’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!\n",
      "43939 Jenny! That is so Jenny!\n",
      "43968 You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?\n",
      "43970 WhatÂ’s funny about that?\n",
      "43972 Hey thatÂ’s okay. So, where do you want to go?\n",
      "43974 The Hard Rock Caf?\n",
      "43976 Again?!\n",
      "43979 You like the Purple Rain display! (A guy walks up.) Hey Bob.\n",
      "43982 Yeah, he thinks thatÂ’s my name.\n",
      "43984 Oh itÂ’s been going on way to long now. YÂ’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnÂ’t say anything. And then the next time he said, \"Hey Toby, do you want a donut?\" And I-I wanted a donut. And now itÂ’s five years later, the donutÂ’s gone and IÂ’m still Toby.\n",
      "43986 No! That would be so awkward! LookÂ—Besides, we work in different departments. HeÂ’s on the sixth floor yÂ’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. WhatÂ’s the big deal? It could be worse, itÂ’s not like heÂ’s calling me Muriel. (Chandler suddenly freezes into place.)\n",
      "43988 Shh! It is a family name!\n",
      "44045 Hey Bob.\n",
      "44047 If I see him, IÂ’ll ask.\n",
      "44050 Yeah!\n",
      "44052 WeÂ’re on a semi-first name basis.\n",
      "44054 Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I donÂ’t know if he has what it takes.\n",
      "44056 But this is eleven. ItÂ’s almost twice as hard up here.\n",
      "44058 I think itÂ’s best sir.\n",
      "44060 YÂ’know what you should do, just toss Â‘em in the shedder and claim you never got Â‘em.\n",
      "44062 What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!\n",
      "44085 Sure, whatÂ’s up?\n",
      "44163 Hey Bobby.\n",
      "44165 Uhh yeah. Yeah, itÂ’s (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?\n",
      "44167 Okay Bob listen uhh, IÂ’m the reason you didnÂ’t get the job up here.\n",
      "44169 Bob!\n",
      "44171 Well that puts me in a difficult position.\n",
      "44240 (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!\n",
      "44253 YouÂ’re an actor!\n",
      "44296 (entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume\n",
      "44299 The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!\n",
      "44301 No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!\n",
      "44305 How is that me?\n",
      "44308 When have I ever done that?!\n",
      "44325 Wow! I donÂ’t have the worst costume anymore!\n",
      "44387 Oh! Hi!\n",
      "44389 JoeyÂ’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youÂ’d come by as a slutty nurse.\n",
      "44391 YouÂ’d think that would embarrass me, but you see IÂ’m maxed out.\n",
      "44399 (To Ross) Marry her.\n",
      "44417 Howdy doody.\n",
      "44419 Oh relax man, relax. YouÂ’re looking a little flushed.\n",
      "44421 What question?\n",
      "44423 ThereÂ’s no question.\n",
      "44425 (To Monica) You picked Ross?!\n",
      "44427 I cannot believe you didnÂ’t pick me.\n",
      "44429 Oh really?! You think youÂ’re stronger? Why donÂ’t you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)\n",
      "44435 (To Ross) YouÂ’re going down.\n",
      "44458 That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!\n",
      "44477 And dignity.\n",
      "44485 Nope! I can do this all day.\n",
      "44487 God, IÂ’m exhausted.\n",
      "44489 No way! If anything youÂ’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks IÂ’m a wimp!\n",
      "44491 YouÂ’re Spudnik.\n",
      "44493 Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!\n",
      "44526 Listen, IÂ’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.\n",
      "44528 No, I let him winÂ—Ross!\n",
      "44530 Would you tell her I let you win please?\n",
      "44532 I am strong! IÂ’ll show you! (He sits down at the table.)\n",
      "44534 Oh whatÂ’s the matter? Are you scared?\n",
      "44536 Okay. 1Â…",
      "2Â…",
      "3Â—Go! (Once again heÂ’s at a stalemate, but this time heÂ’s in pain.) (Pause) IÂ’m gonna kill myself!\n",
      "44538 Hey.\n",
      "44540 YÂ’know uh, I didnÂ’t actually do this.\n",
      "44542 No, it wasnÂ’t you.\n",
      "44544 I got a maid. Yay!\n",
      "44546 Uh honey, I know you donÂ’t like to relinquish control\n",
      "44548 Look, sheÂ’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.\n",
      "44550 Yes, I distinctly remember Â‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?\n",
      "44552 WhatÂ’s the matter?\n",
      "44615 See? I told you.\n",
      "44617 (pause) What?\n",
      "44619 So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?\n",
      "44621 She mustÂ’ve been planning this for years!\n",
      "44623 Honey, isnÂ’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?\n",
      "44625 So, shouldnÂ’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we goÂ…",
      "snooping around her crotch?\n",
      "44627 Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?\n",
      "44701 (entering) Hi!\n",
      "44703 How come?\n",
      "44705 To see her pants?\n",
      "44707 Are you sure? Did you see the stain?\n",
      "44709 God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?\n",
      "44711 Oh dear God!\n",
      "44713 And yet you donÂ’t recognize that youÂ’re crazy.\n",
      "44715 HereÂ’s another planÂ…",
      "No!\n",
      "44717 Why?\n",
      "44719 I fear a jury will see it the same way!\n",
      "44721 You see that?\n",
      "44723 All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if itÂ’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!\n",
      "44725 You need new clothes.\n",
      "44755 IÂ’m leaning. This is where I lean.\n",
      "44757 Brenda a bee!\n",
      "44759 Yes! ItÂ’s flown into your blouse and youÂ’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!\n",
      "44761 You do?\n",
      "44763 I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?\n",
      "44823 Her what?!!\n",
      "44825 You had a bachelorette party?!\n",
      "44827 I thought we werenÂ’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! YÂ’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.\n",
      "44832 You went home with the waitress.\n",
      "44834 I canÂ’t believe you didnÂ’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!\n",
      "44877 My God! You must be good in bed!\n",
      "44882 SheÂ’s okay with Rachel and the baby?\n",
      "44884 Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youÂ’re going down the same path, but youÂ’re really going down different ones.\n",
      "44887 What?\n",
      "44889 Honey! ThatÂ’s crazy! I donÂ’t want you to get me a stripper\n",
      "44892 Look, I appreciate it, but uh, itÂ’s a little creepy. YÂ’know? IÂ’m not a bachelor anymore.\n",
      "44896 All right fine! But IÂ’m only doing this for you!\n",
      "44898 And Joey.\n",
      "44900 Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.\n",
      "44902 I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?\n",
      "44921 What are you doing?\n",
      "44923 Okay. I canÂ’t believe tomorrowÂ’s the big day.\n",
      "44925 YouÂ’re right, this is more fun.\n",
      "44928 Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)\n",
      "44931 ThatÂ’s me.\n",
      "44934 Yeah, yeah right over there.\n",
      "44936 That was weird.\n",
      "44939 So sheÂ’s a\n",
      "44965 I canÂ’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!\n",
      "44967 Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) MaÂ’am, are you also a stripper?\n",
      "44970 That is funny, maybe for my birthday sheÂ’ll murder someone.\n",
      "44973 Oh actually, IÂ’d rather youÂ…",
      "Yeah, go ahead. WeÂ’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.\n",
      "44992 Why would she do that?\n",
      "44994 This is the worst bachelor party ever!\n",
      "44997 (To Joey) In a minute? WhatÂ’s gonna happen in a minute?!\n",
      "44999 Why me?!\n",
      "45001 Which is why you should do it.\n",
      "45003 You do it!\n",
      "45005 All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?\n",
      "45007 I donÂ’t think weÂ’ve actually done this before!\n",
      "45009 Well weÂ…",
      "we still hang out.\n",
      "45011 Well yÂ’know, things are different. IÂ’mÂ…",
      "IÂ’m married now.\n",
      "45013 Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on weÂ’ll make time to hang out with each other.\n",
      "45051 Her ass print is still on your grandmotherÂ’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?\n",
      "45053 Monica! Wait!\n",
      "45055 (puts on his crown) Carry on.\n",
      "45057 Could you not narrate?\n",
      "45110 I have no idea.\n",
      "45112 Yeah! IÂ’m just pretending to watch the game so I donÂ’t have to help out with stuff.\n",
      "45114 Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.\n",
      "45116 Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) ThereÂ’s no Anderson.\n",
      "45131 Oh hey. IÂ’d shake your hand but uh; IÂ’m really into the game. Plus, I think itÂ’d be better for my ego if we didnÂ’t stand right next to each other.\n",
      "45137 IÂ’m watching the game, but IÂ’m not deaf!\n",
      "45146 (To Phoebe) YÂ’know, itÂ’s been a while since weÂ’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.\n",
      "45148 Oh come on!\n",
      "45188 Good game!\n",
      "45190 Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.\n",
      "45193 (simultaneously) Detroit.\n",
      "45264 Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!\n",
      "45293 IÂ’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?\n",
      "45295 Did she look 16?\n",
      "45299 Well, she probably wasnÂ’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!\n",
      "45329 Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.\n",
      "45338 New haircut? (Monica nods Â‘No.Â’) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods Â‘Yes.Â’) Boots!\n",
      "45340 Oh my God!\n",
      "45342 IÂ’m gonna miss being able to afford food.\n",
      "45344 She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)\n",
      "45349 Yeah well, too bad weÂ’re gonna have to return them.\n",
      "45352 I have you.\n",
      "45389 Hey-hey.\n",
      "45394 You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)\n",
      "45405 (returning to his seat) Hey!\n",
      "45407 (spinning around looking for him) I donÂ’t think you did a very thorough job!\n",
      "45438 (opening the door) WhatÂ’s wrong?\n",
      "45440 Oh donÂ’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)\n",
      "45442 Now sweetie, I know you donÂ’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has aÂ…",
      "supple leather lining.\n",
      "45444 Why not?\n",
      "45446 Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?\n",
      "45448 You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!\n",
      "45450 Okay.\n",
      "45496 YÂ’know, that party wasnÂ’t bad.\n",
      "45498 I donÂ’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?\n",
      "45500 What honey, itÂ’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. LetÂ’s go.\n",
      "45502 WhatÂ’s going on?\n",
      "45504 What?\n",
      "45506 So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) ItÂ’s oddly unsettling.\n",
      "45508 Hop on.\n",
      "45510 Honey, I know youÂ’re in pain right now, but IÂ’m a little turned on.\n",
      "45558 Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.\n",
      "45560 Oh IÂ’m sorry! Do you need a break?\n",
      "45562 I can see it from right here. ItÂ’ll cost you one husband.\n",
      "45564 (pause) I donÂ’t have your boots.\n",
      "45566 Well, why donÂ’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!\n",
      "45568 Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?\n",
      "45570 YÂ’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.\n",
      "45572 Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)\n",
      "45653 Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?\n",
      "45656 I didnÂ’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, IÂ’m sorry.\n",
      "45663 No.\n",
      "45665 Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnÂ’t it?\n",
      "45741 Oh uh, as it turns out, we canÂ’t do it. Monica has to work.\n",
      "45743 Oh uh well tomorrowÂ’s no good for her either.\n",
      "45745 ItÂ’s the semi-finalsÂ…",
      "of herÂ…",
      "botchy ball tournament.\n",
      "45747 Well now-now youÂ’re just talking crazy.\n",
      "45749 Because uh... we-we... we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me\n",
      "45751 Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?\n",
      "45753 Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with that bitch.\n",
      "45785 Oh thatÂ’s all right sir, and thatÂ’s just one girl.\n",
      "45788 Oh no-no-no!\n",
      "45798 Hi honey IÂ’m home.\n",
      "45800 It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnÂ’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!\n",
      "45802 YÂ’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like ItÂ’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.\n",
      "45804 Ooh, I donÂ’t know if weÂ’re there yet.\n",
      "45839 Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?\n",
      "45845 Oh, okay.\n",
      "45847 I kinda like it here.\n",
      "45852 Well what did it do?\n",
      "45854 A vending machine?\n",
      "45880 Who cares? ItÂ’s a stupid game.\n",
      "45882 I donÂ’t suck. ItÂ’s sucks. You suck.\n",
      "45885 Why do you want to play this game so bad?\n",
      "45937 You are not going to believe what I did today!\n",
      "45940 Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! (Holds up his hand to give Monica a high five, only he canÂ’t straighten his fingers.)\n",
      "45942 Well IÂ’ve been playing it for like eight hours, itÂ’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyÂ’re dirty words.\n",
      "45944 Because itÂ’s awesome.\n",
      "45946 Well yÂ’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.\n",
      "45948 It is when you put it together with that one.\n",
      "45950 Come on, he wonÂ’t even know what they mean.\n",
      "45952 Have you talked to him lately?\n",
      "45954 No-no-no, if you unplug it, IÂ’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. (She unplugs it.) No! (And plugs it back in.) Hey look at that! Look at that, itÂ’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM (Read Only Memory, itÂ’s a memory chip.) Chip in it or something!\n",
      "45956 With the claw?!\n",
      "46017 I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.\n",
      "46019 Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both look at him.) Was it just me?!\n",
      "46031 One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)\n",
      "46034 All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!\n",
      "46056 Are you, are you high?\n",
      "46058 Really? I donÂ’t like baths.\n",
      "46060 Honey, itÂ’s not the bath I enjoy, itÂ’s the wet, naked lady.\n",
      "46062 Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.\n",
      "46064 Honey, itÂ’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and IÂ’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?\n",
      "46066 Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?\n",
      "46068 Oh my God, whatÂ’s up?!\n",
      "46070 Oh no-no, no you donÂ’t, just come back.\n",
      "46072 Do you?\n",
      "46074 In London?\n",
      "46076 Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.\n",
      "46078 If that.Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch. Ross sits down.]\n",
      "46123 Hey.\n",
      "46125 Sex on the balcony?\n",
      "46127 What is it?\n",
      "46129 Honey, I donÂ’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?\n",
      "46131 Well, this does butch it up a bit.\n",
      "46133 All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?\n",
      "46136 (thinking) All right, this isnÂ’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because IÂ’ve got my boat.\n",
      "46138 Oh my God.\n",
      "46140 IÂ’m going to need a bigger boat.Scene: The DoctorÂ’s Office, the doctor is writing something as Rachel is on the table, and Ross is standing.]\n",
      "46162 IÂ’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think thereÂ’s something wrong.\n",
      "46164 IÂ’m in the bathtub.\n",
      "46166 I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waterÂ’s tepid. The salt didnÂ’t dissolve and is nowÂ…",
      " lodged places. And the scents I used donÂ’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileÂ—Oh!\n",
      "46169 Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!\n",
      "46171 I had the exact same conversation.\n",
      "46174 All right, letÂ’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?\n",
      "46176 Uh-huh.\n",
      "46178 He didnÂ’t say anything about that to me.\n",
      "46180 He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.\n",
      "46182 But what did he mean by rules?\n",
      "46184 Because he was looking at her differently.\n",
      "46186 My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!\n",
      "46189 You donÂ’t say anything.\n",
      "46191 IÂ’m not going to let you say anything.\n",
      "46193 Oh, God! (Monica runs out to Phoebe, who is in the kitchen)\n",
      "46269 Do I smell essential oils?\n",
      "46271 Okay. (As soon as Monica leaves the room, Chandler takes off his jacket and runs to the bathroom. Monica enters the bathroom to find Chandler in the bathtub.)\n",
      "46273 L-leaving my troubles behind?\n",
      "46275 Oh, itÂ’s so hard to care when youÂ’re this relaxed.\n",
      "46277 (upset) Hey!\n",
      "46279 (To Monica) You told her?!\n",
      "46288 (sarcastically) Because itÂ’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!\n",
      "46291 You like Rachel?!\n",
      "46302 IÂ’llÂ…",
      "IÂ’ll get you later!Scene: Joey and RachelÂ’s, Joey is sitting at the counter eating Cocoa Puffs.]\n",
      "46307 Yeah. And what youÂ’re doing feels so good.\n",
      "46309 YouÂ’re not?\n",
      "46311 Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!\n",
      "46330 Hey Pheebs, whatÂ’s up?\n",
      "46335 Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningÂ…",
      "DonÂ’t let Phoebe in.\n",
      "46341 Well, Phoebe I thought IÂ’dÂ—(Off PhoebeÂ’s look)Â—Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)\n",
      "46365 Hey babe.\n",
      "46367 Who says you canÂ’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?\n",
      "46369 How about to the street say from the balcony?\n",
      "46371 Okay. How about in that cabinet?\n",
      "46373 How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)\n",
      "46375 Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) ItÂ’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?\n",
      "46377 Oh yÂ’know, IÂ’ve been living here a while and IÂ’ve never seen whatÂ’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?\n",
      "46379 DonÂ’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!\n",
      "46381 Fine.\n",
      "46383 (walking casually away) Love you.\n",
      "46385 Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, \"If it helps!\" (Goes to the bedroom.)\n",
      "46418 I wasnÂ’t trying to open your closet! I wasnÂ’t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)\n",
      "46420 Monica has a secret closet and she wonÂ’t let me see whatÂ’s in it.\n",
      "46422 I donÂ’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I canÂ’t see?!\n",
      "46424 Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?\n",
      "46426 And here we go\n",
      "46469 There has got to be a way!\n",
      "46471 Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, IÂ’m not an nine-year-old girl.\n",
      "46473 Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.\n",
      "46475 So, howÂ’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?\n",
      "46477 ThatÂ’s a good idea.\n",
      "46479 Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?\n",
      "46481 Well, itÂ’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? YÂ’know? YouÂ’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if youÂ’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?\n",
      "46544 Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfÂ…",
      "using my wifeÂ’s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see whatÂ’s behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!\n",
      "46546 (laughs) YouÂ’re messy.\n",
      "46548 I married Fred Sanford!\n",
      "46550 No, honey youÂ’re not sick! Look, I donÂ’t love you because youÂ’re organized, I love you in spite of that.\n",
      "46552 Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.\n",
      "46554 Hey.\n",
      "46556 So RachelÂ’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?\n",
      "46558 Are you okay?\n",
      "46609 Happy ValentineÂ’s!\n",
      "46611 (picking up a video from the table) Â‘Candy and CookieÂ’. Â‘Candy and Cookie?Â’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some \"porn\") (A woman on TV breaths hard)\n",
      "46613 I love you, St. Valentine. (The woman groans, moans, grunts, and screams. ChandlerÂ’s eyes get huge!)\n",
      "46614 Woah, woah, thatÂ’s not pretty!\n",
      "46617 Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)\n",
      "46619 I am trying!Scene: JoeyÂ’s. Joey is playing fetch with the dog.\n",
      "46630 (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?\n",
      "46632 ItÂ’s yellingÂ…",
      "bleedingÂ…",
      "dilating. Oh, the dilating\n",
      "46634 I thoughtÂ…",
      "maybeÂ…",
      "you got me porn for ValentineÂ’s Day.\n",
      "46636 Well, IÂ’m not really in a sexy mood right now.\n",
      "46638 Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?\n",
      "46640 How long it took to go back in the water?\n",
      "46642 You donÂ’t know. You didnÂ’t see it.\n",
      "46644 Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like heÂ’s going to throw up!)\n",
      "46646 See, honey, thereÂ’sÂ—(puts his hand on her leg)\n",
      "46725 90 seconds.\n",
      "46727 You know, it haunts me? Up Â‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!\n",
      "46729 I can do that.\n",
      "46731 Okay. Now all weÂ’ve got to do is get rid of this chair. (Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they canÂ’t do it and back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone knocks on the door.)\n",
      "46733 Oh, I know!\n",
      "46737 Poor Ross. (Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the action in RossÂ’ apartment)\n",
      "46738 Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!\n",
      "46740 Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: donÂ’t watch it.\n",
      "46742 Well, letÂ’s just say itÂ’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.\n",
      "46747 (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.\n",
      "46749 Why have I seen this thing three times?!\n",
      "46754 Wait, you guys, look!\n",
      "46756 No, the babyÂ’s out! Look, look!\n",
      "46758 And look how happy the mom is now!\n",
      "46824 Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) SheÂ’s growing inside you.\n",
      "46826 Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)\n",
      "46828 I think thatÂ’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.\n",
      "46830 Oh hey!\n",
      "46835 No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I donÂ’t think they exist.\n",
      "46837 Why?\n",
      "46839 What?\n",
      "46841 Come on, donÂ’t be crazy. (To Rachel) You donÂ’t think thereÂ’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)\n",
      "46847 A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!\n",
      "46854 Luckily, the guy she settled for canÂ’t hear what youÂ’re talking about.\n",
      "46856 You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youÂ’re still gonna date him?\n",
      "46880 (mouths to Phoebe) What?\n",
      "46887 WhatÂ’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still thereÂ’s staring.) No?\n",
      "46895 What are you doing?!\n",
      "46897 I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!\n",
      "46936 Cheese you say? ThatÂ’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?\n",
      "46938 Cheese, itÂ’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.\n",
      "46944 Is it made of cheese?\n",
      "46947 (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?\n",
      "46949 What do we do?\n",
      "46961 Sure, why donÂ’t you set it up. IÂ’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.\n",
      "46963 Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.\n",
      "46965 IÂ’m sorry, did you say cheese?\n",
      "46967 Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I donÂ’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wonÂ’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.\n",
      "46969 No. But IÂ’m sure (mimics Don) Â‘tomatoesÂ’ does.\n",
      "46971 You donÂ’t?\n",
      "46973 So youÂ…",
      "you donÂ’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?\n",
      "46975 I love you.\n",
      "46977 YÂ’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesnÂ’t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.\n",
      "47028 Hey!\n",
      "47031 I donÂ’t see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?\n",
      "47039 What?! No! No!\n",
      "47045 (incredulous) I donÂ’t know what thatÂ’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \"I love you,\" was, \"Oh crap!\"\n",
      "47050 (interrupting him) We didnÂ’t play it!!\n",
      "47052 I didnÂ’t know you read tea leaves.\n",
      "47063 What does yours say Pheebs?\n",
      "47070 Well, IÂ’m sure you get another one at Ann TaylorÂ’s.\n",
      "47075 Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?\n",
      "47082 I know itÂ’s tough now, but things will get better.\n",
      "47084 IÂ’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?\n",
      "47086 LetÂ’s just say if I canÂ’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.\n",
      "47088 In the James Taylor case.\n",
      "47090 Honey, IÂ’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.\n",
      "47092 Well, if weÂ’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. YÂ’know alphabetically or by genre?\n",
      "47100 They were just giving those away at the store (off MonicaÂ’s look) in exchange for money.\n",
      "47136 Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.\n",
      "47141 What problem did you tell him you had?\n",
      "47170 (singing) The sunÂ’ll come outÂ…",
      "tomorrow! BetÂ…",
      "your bottom dollar that tomorrowÂ…",

      "47226 Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyÂ’re not in the baby buying business.\n",
      "47228 Oh IÂ’m sorry, youÂ’re kicking me out of my own living room?\n",
      "47230 IÂ’ll be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)\n",
      "47251 Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?\n",
      "47258 And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?\n",
      "47263 What are you doing?\n",
      "47265 ItÂ’s a dog.\n",

      "47277 Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.\n",
      "47285 Ha!\n",
      "47297 Yeah.\n",
      "47340 I donÂ’t think the flash went off.\n",
      "47344 Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.\n",

      "48070 I canÂ’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?\n",
      "48072 Oh good. Good, because IÂ’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.\n",
      "48074 An hour.\n",
      "48076 Phoebe!\n",
      "48078 Chandler Bing.\n",
      "48080 Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) IÂ’ll let myself out.\n",
      "48094 I think youÂ’ll find if I come to work here, I donÂ’t micro-manage. I donÂ’t shy away from delegating.\n",
      "48096 (suppressing a smile) What I do doÂ…",
      "is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.\n",
      "48098 Hardest thing IÂ’ve ever done in my life.\n",
      "48100 Oh! (Stands up.)\n",
      "48102 Really?\n",
      "48104 Okay.\n",
      "48128 also I was the point person on my companyÂ’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.\n",
      "48130 That I did. That I did.\n",
      "48132 (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.\n",
      "48134 (trying not to laugh) I see.\n",
      "48136 (really try not to laugh) Good to know.\n",
      "48138 No donÂ’t I beg of you!\n",
      "48140 (relieved) Really?!\n",
      "48142 Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. YÂ’know IÂ’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesnÂ’t understand) Duties. (Still doesnÂ’t.) Duties! (Still doesnÂ’t.) Poo. (Still doesnÂ’t.)\n",
      "48144 Oh my God this doesnÂ’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! ThereÂ’s a crazy guy out in the hall!\n",
      "48146 IÂ’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)\n",
      "48214 LetÂ’s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)\n",
      "48215 Hey! Did you have the baby yet?\n",
      "48232 HeÂ’s not snoozing, heÂ’s teaching a class.\n",
      "48234 I havenÂ’t seen this dress.\n",
      "48239 You really want to take me?\n",
      "48241 So youÂ’re never actually going to pay me back?\n",
      "48244 I always knew you were gonna make it. IÂ’m so proud of you.\n",
      "48248 (in a manly voice) Yeah well, IÂ’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)\n",
      "48261 This is so exciting! ItÂ’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?\n",
      "48263 What?\n",
      "48265 ItÂ’s just so glamorous.\n",
      "48323 Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!\n",
      "48325 Oh-ho-ho, yeah!\n",
      "48327 The whole thing! Can we go?\n",
      "48329 I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!\n",
      "48331 I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.\n",
      "48333 DonÂ’t go! IÂ’m sorry. IÂ’m so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.\n",
      "48361 Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!\n",
      "48363 IÂ’m so sorry.\n",
      "48365 What?!\n",
      "48367 You donÂ’t owe me anything, I donÂ’t want you money\n",
      "48369 I donÂ’t know, five hundred dollars?\n",
      "48371 Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.\n",
      "48373 Do you want a calculator?\n",
      "48375 Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)\n",
      "48377 Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes\n",
      "48379 Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.\n",
      "48381 Yes, money well spent!\n",
      "48383 Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food\n",
      "48438 Hi!\n",
      "48446 Man, if only youÂ’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)\n",
      "48501 Yeah?\n",
      "48503 Okay.\n",
      "48505 Okay. IÂ’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think weÂ’re ready.\n",
      "48509 But you said you were ready too.\n",
      "48511 Yes, but havenÂ’t you wanted a kid like forever?\n",
      "48581 IÂ’m not crazy about babies. IÂ’m crazy about us.\n",
      "48583 Look, weÂ’ve always talked about having babies someday. IÂ’m not saying it has to be right now, but IÂ’m starting to think that we can handle it. WeÂ’re good. WeÂ’re really good.\n",
      "48585 But nothing has to happen until your ready.\n",
      "48587 What?! ItÂ’s not right! WeÂ’re not ready to have a kid now!!\n",
      "48589 IÂ’m kidding. This is going to be fun.\n",
      "48591 WeÂ’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) YÂ’know IÂ’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?\n",
      "48593 Period math?\n",
      "48595 Yeah.\n",
      "48597 Right here?\n",
      "48599 Wait a minute, itÂ’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and weÂ’re in a building thatÂ’s full of beds!\n",
      "48649 Okay. (They start kissing.)\n",
      "48651 Okay. Uh, weÂ’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds itÂ’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)\n",
      "48654 Yes, 98.6. YouÂ’re gonna be fine.\n",
      "48738 Should we tell Rachel thereÂ’s an empty private room right next door to hers?\n",
      "48740 Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!\n",
      "48743 If itÂ’s not, then thereÂ’s two of them. And that would mean itÂ’s the end of the world!\n",
      "48746 Hi.\n",
      "48750 Weirdest thing. Did I hearÂ—(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)Â—Mother of God itÂ’s true!\n",
      "48752 Jan-Janice!\n",
      "48755 Janice I didnÂ’t even know you were pregnant! WhoÂ’s the unwitting human whoÂ’s essence youÂ’ve stolen?\n",
      "48757 What?!\n",
      "48759 ThatÂ’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?\n",
      "48844 ItÂ’s incredible, I mean one minute sheÂ’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.\n",
      "48856 So, do you know what youÂ’re gonna call her yet?\n",
      "48862 So then I guess Ferdinad is out.\n",

      "49643 No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.\n",
      "49645 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.\n",
      "49647 Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\n",

      "49685 What?\n",
      "49687 How far outside?\n",
      "49689 And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.\n",
      "49691 What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\n",
      "49693 I think you should take the job.\n",

      "49705 Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\n",
      "49708 Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\n",
      "49710 That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\n",

      "49762 (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?\n",
      "49764 Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?\n",
      "49766 Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!\n",
      "49769 I know.\n",
      "49771 I know that too. (They kiss)\n",

      "49876 (enters singing) Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym (sits down) who am I kidding pay-per-view porn.\n",
      "49878 DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica: (smiles)\n",
      "49880 everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (She hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the TV and sees sharks swimming around thinking Chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)\n",
      "49882 Ok honey. that was close.\n",
      "49970 Hi honey I'm home!\n",
      "49972 oh it was great.\n",
      "49974 well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!\n",
      "49976 (Chandler looking confused) Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.\n",

      "49992 You are an amazing wife. (Monica shrugs) No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.\n",
      "50014 Good morning everyone, its nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?\n",
      "50016 (laughs) Well, dont believe everything you hear, Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah, thats true. Alright, lets get started, by take a look at last quarters figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her:) Ah, Claudia, arent you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses ass?\n",
      "50018 No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I cant remember why. (to everyone:) Youre not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?\n",
      "50020 Alright, lolook. I dont smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, its fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? Thats almost rude, that Im not.\n",
      "50022 (loud) Ken, please! No, I cant, I cant smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.\n",
      "50024 I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)\n",
      "50034 Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.\n",
      "50036 No! I just happened tdo a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.\n",
      "50038 Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?\n",

      "50044 No thanks, Im good.\n",
      "50046 (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so Im feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.\n",
      "50048 (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.\n",
      "50050 Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packaa carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But its over, I made a decision, Im not gonna smoke anymore.\n",
      "50052 But, those are for you.\n",
      "50086 I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.\n",
      "50088 Will power? Ive watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.\n",
      "50090 kay, look: Can we just drop this? Im not gonna smoke again.\n",
      "50092 You forbid me?\n",
      "50094 You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?\n",
      "50096 Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?\n",
      "50098 Then, I might as well  (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.\n",

      "50147 Yeah, lets celebrate life!\n",
      "50154 Uhh. You are welcome.\n",
      "50156 What?\n",
      "50158 But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesno big deal.\n",
      "50160 Leave it.\n",
      "50162 You tricked me to get me into bed?\n",
      "50164 I feel so used.\n",
      "50196 I would never lie to get someone into bed.\n",
      "50198 I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative shrew.\n",
      "50203 You mean the lully story?\n",
      "50222 Oh yeah, thats what she says. But maybe youre not ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed.\n",
      "50224 (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.\n",
      "50226 Whats the matter with me? Why Im such a girl?\n",
      "50238 So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?\n",
      "50252 (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?\n",
      "50254 Honey, you're screaming.\n",
      "50256 (yawning) Oh, that's great.\n",
      "50258 (clearly not so interested) Awesome.\n",
      "50328 (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)\n",
      "50330 Hey!\n",
      "50332 So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.\n",
      "50334 (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.\n",
      "50336 What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?\n",
      "50338 Yeah, he came up...\n",
      "50340 (to Phoebe) Were you there?\n",
      "50370 Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.\n",
      "50372 (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.\n",
      "50374 Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.\n",
      "50376 Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?\n",
      "50378 Yeah!\n",
      "50380 Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)\n",
      "50453 Hey!\n",
      "50455 What are you guys talking about?\n",
      "50457 You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)\n",
      "50458 You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)\n",
      "50460 If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)\n",
      "50462 What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)\n",
      "50464 Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)\n",
      "50466 So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)\n",
      "50468 Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?\n",
      "50470 I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.\n",
      "50525 Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.\n",
      "50527 Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!\n",
      "50529 I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)\n",
      "50531 See ya! (he leaves the apartment)\n",
      "50570 Hi!\n",
      "50572 How come?\n",
      "50576 Do you have any ideas?\n",
      "50583 (imitating Monica) Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!\n",
      "50585 Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.\n",
      "50620 So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?\n",
      "50622 mmm That's enough about you!\n",
      "50625 No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.\n",
      "50628 We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! (laughs) You don't think he's here, do you? (Joey looks around)\n",
      "50630 (Chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by Richard's video collection) Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!\n",
      "50632 There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.\n",
      "50634 Get there faster! (Joey gasps and finally understands...)\n",
      "50689 I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) Well, we know I'm gonna watch it. (Chandler moves to put the tape in the VCR and Joey enters the apartment)\n",
      "50691 Don't judge me, I'm only human!\n",
      "50693 I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?\n",
      "50695 Some girl...!?\n",
      "50697 Yeah...!?\n",
      "50699 Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) Can it?\n",
      "50701 Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.\n",
      "50703 Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?\n",
      "50705 Why am I hearing cheering?\n",
      "50707 Football? Just football?\n",
      "50709 It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... (Chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the TV and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... Joey's eyes double in size...) What the... (Chandler turns around, but Joey already took a sprint for Chandler, jumps, and floors Chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) What are you doing?\n",
      "50733 Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!\n",
      "50737 Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.\n",
      "50739 This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.\n",
      "50741 Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!\n",
      "50743 Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...\n",
      "50745 Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.\n",
      "50747 What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!\n",
      "50749 Is that a problem?\n",
      "50789 Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?\n",
      "50791 Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.\n",
      "50793 What is the point of having them if we never use them?\n",
      "50795 I will explain it to her.\n",
      "50799 Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo! TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .\n",
      "50802 Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?\n",
      "50806 What are you going to do?\n",
      "50808 Well you proved them wrong.\n",
      "50854 I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..\n",
      "50856 Why?\n",
      "50858 Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? < Phoebe comes in>\n",
      "50940 I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.\n",
      "50945 You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>\n",
      "50966 No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?\n",
      "50969 Actually what?\n",
      "50971 What?\n",
      "50976 So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?\n",
      "50980 Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!\n",
      "50985 Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?\n",
      "50987 Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table> she'd have to give her up.\n",
      "50990 So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?\n",
      "50994 Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?\n",
      "50996 Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.\n",
      "50998 Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.\n",
      "51000 Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You're grounded\"?\n",
      "51002 You said that to me last week.\n",
      "51020 Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.\n",
      "51076 Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.\n",
      "51079 Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.\n",
      "51081 By the way, that fight was totally arousing.\n",
      "51083 Oh yeah? Well thanks.\n",
      "51085 Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.\n",
      "51099 Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.\n",
      "51101 Nope...\n",
      "51103 Yep...\n",
      "51105 Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.\n",
      "51107 Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)\n",
      "51391 (coming from the bedroom) Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.\n",
      "51394 Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.\n",
      "51396 So, who does?\n",
      "51401 I'm sorry, I won't be here.\n",
      "51403 Thanks. (they kiss) I'll see you New Year's Day.\n",
      "51405 Did I not mention that?\n",
      "51407 (thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! (and runs out of the apartment)\n",
      "51408 All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call (he takes it off) for writing \"Screw you, Mr. Bing!\" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.\n",
      "51411 Hey. Where've you been?\n",
      "51413 (to the others) You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.\n",
      "51415 Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.\n",
      "51417 Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!\n",
      "51419 I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.\n",
      "51421 Haha, no thanks!\n",
      "51423 Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.\n",
      "51425 Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...\n",
      "51431 I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.\n",
      "51434 What? That's terrible!\n",
      "51436 Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.\n",
      "51439 No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!\n",
      "51441 No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.\n",
      "51443 Why?\n",
      "51445 No, I have a great idea for a present for her.\n",
      "51448 If I help, we can find 'em faster!\n",
      "51458 OK, Pheebs, your turn.\n",
      "51464 And, a lemon lime.\n",
      "51466 And last but not least.\n",
      "51473 (entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\n",
      "51475 Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)\n",
      "51477 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?\n",
      "51479 What?\n",
      "51482 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\n",
      "51484 Why?\n",
      "51486 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\n",
      "51488 Fine, I'll give the suit back.\n",
      "51490 Santa? Really?\n",
      "51492 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\n",
      "51494 Then it's okaaay! (They kiss.)\n",
      "51495 You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.\n",
      "51496 Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.\n",
      "51497 Good, God's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees Wendy) You're not gonna go?\n",
      "51499 Ah. Thanks.\n",
      "51501 Ah. (The phone rings; he answers it) Chandler Bing.\n",
      "51505 Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!\n",
      "51507 Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.\n",
      "51509 It is. Did I... not tell you about her?\n",
      "51511 I sent them home.\n",
      "51513 Uhh, uh...\n",
      "51515 I don't know!\n",
      "51517 I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.\n",
      "51519 Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.\n",
      "51521 BE-LOW me!\n",
      "51524 Well, she... she didn't win...\n",
      "51526 Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...\n",
      "51528 Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.\n",
      "51530 I'm serious!\n",
      "51532 Merry Christmas.\n",
      "51534 Merry Christmas, you guys!\n",
      "51537 (hanging up the phone) The wife says \"Hi!\".\n",
      "51539 Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.\n",
      "51541 This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.\n",
      "51542 Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! (He takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)\n",
      "51544 I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... (She lets go of his tie) Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?\n",
      "51546 (flattered) No,... no... (realizing) NO! (He quickly gets several steps away from her.) Look, I'm, I'm married!\n",
      "51548 I'm *happily* married.\n",
      "51550 Right. So, I'm sorry...\n",
      "51552 Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.\n",
      "51554 I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!\n",
      "51556 You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\n",
      "51558 But we don't do that.\n",
      "51560 How drunk are you?\n",
      "51562 (thinks) That's the perfect amount!\n",
      "51565 What?\n",
      "51567 I know.\n",
      "51569 Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?\n",
      "51571 Okay!\n",
      "51573 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\n",
      "51575 Yep!\n",
      "51577 Count of three?\n",
      "51579 Two!\n",
      "51582 Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\n",
      "51584 Eh! (They start making out again)\n",
      "51585 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?\n",
      "51587 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.\n",
      "51589 Really? Okay, so...\n",
      "51591 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?\n",
      "51593 Right!\n",
      "51595 Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.\n",
      "51597 Let's go! (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "51599 Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.\n",
      "51601 I don't think so.\n",
      "51603 (looks around) Here just...take this. (Hands her the sweater.)\n",
      "51605 No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.\n",
      "51607 Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)\n",
      "51609 Ehh.\n",
      "51611 Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\n",
      "51613 Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.\n",
      "51615 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\n",
      "51617 Yeah.\n",
      "51619 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\n",
      "51621 Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.\n",
      "51623 Sure you do.\n",
      "51625 You sure?\n",
      "51627 I love you so much.\n",
      "51638 Hey!\n",
      "51642 I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.\n",
      "51644 Monica.\n",
      "51646 I never want to leave you again!\n",
      "51648 Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.\n",
      "51651 Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?\n",
      "51653 (realizing) I have *not* thought this through!\n",
      "51655 I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.\n",
      "51657 Thanks!\n",
      "51659 (flattered) Ahh...\n",
      "51662 (to Monica) Here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)\n",
      "51666 I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.\n",
      "51668 I don't have a *job*!\n",
      "51669 Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to Monica:) Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!\n",
      "51672 Hey\n",
      "51674 Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.\n",
      "51676 I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice - not helping.\n",
      "51692 Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.\n",
      "51694 Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.\n",
      "51700 Now that Rachel's gone?\n",
      "51744 I wasn't staring. I was leering.\n",
      "51747 Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.\n",

      "51788 Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.\n",
      "51790 Picturing that tree?\n",
      "51792 Where you going, Joe?\n",
      "51794 Oh. You mind if I join you?\n",
      "51796 Your thoughts? Plural?\n",
      "51798 I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.\n",

      "51970 See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.\n",
      "51975 Wow.\n",
      "51979 Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!\n",

      "52015 I don't do that.\n",
      "52016 I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?\n",
      "52018 Today is the sixth.\n",

      "52041 I - I don't think I can.\n",
      "52043 Because of Emma.\n",
      "52045 Sorry.\n",
      "52047 Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.\n",
      "52049 Well, I can't say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front of the B-A-B-Y.\n",
      "52051 Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?\n",
      "52053 You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.\n",
      "52087 Emma was doing it!\n",
      "52089 Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...\n",
      "52091 Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.\n",

      "52147 Your family name is Tribbiani.\n",
      "52196 Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)\n",

      "52201 Right. So, it'll be the same exceptÂ…",
      " less sex with you. (Joey nods)\n",
      "52203 Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.\n",
      "52205 Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating\n",
      "52206 (grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!\n",
      "52238 (entering) Good morning, everybody.\n",
      "52240 Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guysÂ…",
      " except for the tie, the briefcaseÂ…",
      " and the fact that I can rent a car.\n",
      "52242 Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.\n",
      "52244 Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down)\n",
      "52245 The comedian? USO?!\n",
      "52310 (entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!\n",
      "52312 I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.\n",
      "52314 Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)\n",
      "52317 They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.\n",
      "52319 What am I supposed to do with these?\n",
      "52321 Well, first of all, they're not called \"sneakers\" anymore. Apparently, they're called \"kicks\" or \"skids\" and I think I heard somebody say \"slorps\". (He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to Monica) Would you help me try to sell these?\n",
      "52323 No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.\n",
      "52386 Hey!\n",
      "52388 Putting on the sneakersÂ…",
      " thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything\n",
      "52390 Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!\n",
      "52398 (sitting on the couch) You know whatÂ…",
      " these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.\n",
      "52400 Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel youger already!\n",
      "52401 (on the floor) Yah, I think I broke my hip.\n",
      "52424 OkayÂ…",
      " (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age\n",
      "52426 A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you knowÂ…",
      " maybe he fallsÂ…",
      " maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: \"Not suitable for adults!\"\n",

      "52433 The cold weather hurts my hip!\n",
      "52465 Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?\n",
      "52467 I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.\n",
      "52469 Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.\n",
      "52471 You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?\n",
      "52473 No! We're not borrowing money.\n",
      "52475 Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.\n",
      "52477 That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.\n",
      "52530 Yeah.... she's not so cute.\n",
      "52537 Yes dear.\n",
      "52550 Hey Joe!\n",
      "52552 Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.\n",
      "52554 And that would have made the official party line. (Joey nods) Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.\n",
      "52556 What? What do you mean you know?\n",
      "52558 Oh! Right.\n",
      "52560 Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.\n",
      "52562 Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! (Joey begins writing a cheque)\n",
      "52564 Oh ok.\n",
      "52568 I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?\n",
      "52570 What?\n",

      "52606 Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.\n",
      "52608 No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.\n",
      "52610 Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.\n",
      "52612 I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.\n",
      "52645 Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. (kisses monica) Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.\n",

      "53463 Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\n",
      "53466 What?\n",
      "53468 Look, we have enough, just walk away.\n",
      "53470 There's a forest right outside.\n",
      "53472 Ok, go quick!\n",
      "53522 I got you something from Vermont! (Sits down at the table)\n",
      "53527 (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.\n",
      "53529 I could fall asleep at a play.\n",
      "53538 (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?\n",
      "53569 Hey!\n",
      "53571 Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.\n",
      "53585 (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.\n",
      "53698 Where the hell is everybody?\n",
      "53747 (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!\n",
      "53749 I... I don't know... you seem lovely.\n",
      "53780 (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?\n",
      "53782 Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.\n",
      "53784 Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: \"fat, single and ready to mingle\", I was uplifted.\n",
      "53786 Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!\n",
      "53788 Did somebody sign your bra?\n",
      "53816 Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.\n",
      "53819 Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).\n",
      "53823 I missed most of the party (pause) Charlie's a girl, right?\n",
      "53839 (to Joey) So, a professor, uh?\n",
      "53875 Oh, yeah?\n",
      "53877 Oh, well... Maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites Monica to have sex on it)\n",
      "53879 We really need to take those tests?\n",
      "53881 But I don't wanna do it in a cup!\n",
      "53883 It's weird! In a doctor's office?\n",
      "53885 (embarrassed) I cannot believe Ross told you that! (pause) And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!\n",
      "53887 Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!\n",
      "53889 Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!\n",
      "53962 I have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.\n",
      "53965 Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.\n",
      "53967 Yeah, I guess!\n",
      "53970 Oh, Come on!\n",
      "53973 Why are you here?\n",
      "53975 (to Heaven) No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??\n",
      "53977 What!?\n",
      "53979 I'd love to stay, but I have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)\n",
      "53981 (disgusted) I think it just fell off. (Leaves)\n",
      "54012 (To the nurse at the nurses' station) My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees Janice is still there) Janice! You're not... gone?\n",
      "54014 Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!\n",
      "54016 I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.\n",
      "54018 (Slightly panicky) Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?\n",
      "54020 (smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...\n",
      "54022 (stares at her intently, then yells) It was a \"Wendy's!! \"\n",
      "54075 (picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.\n",
      "54076 Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. (pause) No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) Oh. (pause) Well, so what does that mean? (pause) Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks. (hangs up)\n",
      "54078 Doctor Connelly just called.\n",
      "54080 Actually it's both of us.\n",
      "54082 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.\n",
      "54084 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) It means...\n",
      "54086 (seriously) It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.\n",
      "54088 I'm sorry.\n",
      "54090 Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.\n",
      "54127 (looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!\n",
      "54129 Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!\n",
      "54131 Hi.\n",
      "54136 Oh, DAMN IT!\n",
      "54141 Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! (Dr. Connelly glares at him) Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!\n",
      "54158 (entering) Hey guys!\n",
      "54160 I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.\n",
      "54162 But you come first!\n",
      "54167 (sitting down on the couch) Ok.\n",
      "54169 Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.\n",
      "54171 Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\n",
      "54173 Yeah.\n",
      "54175 Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.\n",
      "54177 (stopping Joey) ah-ha!\n",
      "54179 I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.\n",
      "54226 Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!\n",
      "54229 You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! (pause) Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.\n",
      "54232 (to Mon) So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?\n",
      "54234 So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!\n",
      "54236 Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!\n",
      "54238 No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.\n",
      "54240 I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!\n",
      "54242 Ok!\n",
      "54244 (bringing the beer to Zack) Zack!\n",
      "54278 So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!\n",
      "54280 You don't like him.\n",
      "54282 Alright! Just follow my lead!\n",
      "54284 Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?\n",
      "54286 (very seriously) That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.\n",
      "54294 You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness (Monica stretches her neck to look behind Zack's head and then gives Chandler an \"ok\" sign)\n",
      "54298 I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?\n",
      "54301 (Proceeding with his dinner) We're teeth people Zack!\n",
      "54361 You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?\n",
      "54363 Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.\n",
      "54365 Ok.\n",
      "54366 I think we've found our sperm!\n",
      "54368 Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?\n",
      "54370 Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!\n",
      "54372 Yeah, he's better!\n",
      "54374 Really? Are you sure?\n",
      "54376 (sighs with relief) Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.\n",
      "54378 So you know this leaves us with...\n",
      "54380 How do you feel about that?\n",
      "54382 Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.\n",
      "54384 (smiling) Yeah.\n",
      "54386 We are gonna be great parents.\n",
      "54388 Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!\n",
      "54389 Hey, Zack!\n",
      "54391 Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "54393 Really?\n",
      "54395 My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.\n",
      "54398 You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?\n",
      "54407 Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, \"island's stuff\".\n",
      "54438 Yeah, that's the same as \"it has something to do with wind\".\n",
      "54446 (upset) She does?\n",
      "54455 I wouldn't read too much into it.\n",
      "54457 David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.\n",
      "54459 Seriously, we're gonna do this?\n",
      "54461 Oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that David is not amused) Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. (pause) They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?\n",
      "54463 What?\n",
      "54465 I didn't mean now...\n",
      "54467 Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.\n",
      "54469 David, I'm pretending to read here!!\n",
      "54500 (smiling cheekily) I do! Want a hint? huh? \"I do\" (Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats) \"I do\".\n",
      "54502 David is going to propose to Phoebe.\n",
      "54504 Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.\n",
      "54506 I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?\n",
      "54508 Man, that's some bad advice!\n",
      "54514 That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!\n",
      "54524 Tonight?! (looks at the ring) Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) Oh, there it is!\n",
      "54526 (slaps him on the shoulder) Nice! (goes to Monica)\n",
      "54527 Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? (Pulls her away from Phoebe and Rachel)\n",
      "54529 David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!\n",
      "54531 That would be advice!!\n",
      "54549 Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?\n",
      "54551 (offended) What? (pause) May I?\n",
      "54555 (at the laptop) Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!\n",
      "54557 Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!\n",
      "54559 It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.\n",
      "54561 Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.\n",
      "54563 Well, it didn't say \"This is a virus\"!!\n",
      "54565 Nude... (Ross looks at him)... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.\n",
      "54567 It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?\n",
      "54569 Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!\n",
      "54572 I just feel awful.\n",
      "54574 Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... (Ross glares at him) you know, you and Monica have the same \"I'm gonna kill you\" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... (Ross continues to glare at him and Chandler leans in as if he's going to kiss Ross)\n",
      "54598 (pretending not to sense the tone) Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!\n",
      "54600 Phoebe is going to say \"yes\"? That's, that's great!\n",
      "54602 And there's not chance that will work?\n",
      "54604 (pointing at her) Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!\n",
      "54606 This vacation sucks!!\n",
      "54684 You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.\n",
      "54687 I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? (doing David) \"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh...\" Spit it out, David!\n",
      "54711 I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.\n",
      "54725 Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.\n",
      "54728 I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!\n",
      "54730 Hey! Remember when I had corneas?\n",
      "54732 Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.\n",
      "54739 (to a paleontologist sitting next to him) Not to mention the cold sores.\n",
      "54741 (to the one sitting next to him) Really?\n",
      "54782 I don't think so!\n",
      "54784 Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!\n",
      "54786 Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?\n",
      "54788 And...?\n",
      "54810 I'm not playing with you.\n",
      "54815 She gets crazy! This scar (points to his forehead) is from Pictionary!\n",
      "54820 (nearly whispering) Oh dear God, there's two of them!\n",
      "54823 (to Phoebe) Did you know this about him?\n",
      "54831 (interrupting her) OK!\n",
      "54834 Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!\n",
      "54909 (to Phoebe) Do you really find this attractive on him?\n",
      "54911 I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.\n",
      "54920 Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.\n",
      "54923 Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?\n",
      "54947 (exhausted) Ok, look! Enough is enough!\n",
      "54949 Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!\n",
      "54951 But...\n",
      "54953 What about the obsessive cleaning?\n",
      "54956 You ok?\n",
      "54961 No, you didn't.\n",
      "54963 Because I'm gonna play for ya.\n",
      "54968 (In a loving voice) Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.\n",
      "54970 (Still in a loving voice) You're welcome, sweetheart.\n",
      "54971 All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.\n",
      "54975 And that's... how... it's done!\n",
      "54977 I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!\n",
      "54979 I don't know.\n",
      "54981 That's why!\n",
      "54997 You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.\n",
      "54999 You're on!\n",
      "55007 He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.\n",
      "55012 She's cheating on Joey with Ross!\n",
      "55025 Wow!\n",
      "55032 How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!\n",
      "55034 Anything?\n",
      "55038 You do realise that's your brother?\n",
      "55040 That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.\n",
      "55042 Okay Buckwheat!\n",
      "55053 And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!\n",
      "55058 (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!\n",
      "55060 He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)\n",
      "55062 You got it!\n",
      "55104 Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?\n",
      "55106 Enunciate!\n",
      "55134 Hey!\n",
      "55136 Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.\n",
      "55138 You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?\n",
      "55152 Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!\n",
      "55154 I think.... I think I can see your scalp.\n",
      "55162 What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.\n",
      "55164 Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.\n",
      "55169 Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.\n",
      "55257 You go back to work tomorrow night, right?\n",
      "55259 So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?\n",
      "55261 What are you singing?\n",
      "55263 It's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse Now\"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!\n",
      "55265 Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.\n",
      "55267 Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.\n",
      "55269 Hit yourself in the tooth?\n",
      "55307 Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?\n",
      "55310 Really? What happened?\n",
      "55312 You can't move at all?\n",
      "55314 If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?\n",
      "55316 (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.\n",
      "55335 Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?\n",
      "55337 I think you know.\n",
      "55339 This is what I want to do.\n",
      "55341 (Picks up the \"Miss Congeniality\" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.\n",
      "55381 There's a hair in my coffee.\n",
      "55385 You know, it's funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.\n",
      "55451 So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?\n",
      "55452 I mean, you have a lovely home.\n",
      "55460 That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?\n",
      "55461 You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?\n",
      "55466 Hey, you must be Owen.\n",
      "55468 I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.\n",
      "55470 Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.\n",
      "55472 You know how to use a compass?\n",
      "55474 You do? That's fantastic!\n",
      "55476 I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.\n",
      "55478 What?\n",
      "55480 I got nothing.\n",
      "55522 Where are Bill and Colleen?\n",
      "55524 We have to leave!!\n",
      "55526 I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.\n",
      "55531 But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?\n",
      "55533 See? Intuitive!\n",
      "55536 Which technically now you should give back!\n",
      "55538 I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. \"Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.\"\n",
      "55600 Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.\n",
      "55603 Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?\n",
      "55604 I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)\n",
      "55606 So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?\n",
      "55608 Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?\n",
      "55610 What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.\n",
      "55612 How can you be so confident?\n",
      "55614 Really? Like you have a routine?\n",
      "55616 Really?\n",
      "55618 You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)\n",
      "55620 Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarassed)\n",
      "55622 ...and beer!!\n",
      "55627 Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!\n",
      "55629 She went on one of those spray-on tan places.\n",
      "55633 (To Monica) Why...why?\n",
      "55635 Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.\n",
      "55640 Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "55644 Who's Amanda?\n",
      "55646 Are you trying to do a British accent?\n",
      "55648 Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?\n",
      "55657 No, had it done to me though. Feels good !\n",
      "55702 Hello? Is someone on the line?\n",
      "55704 Hang on, sheâ€™s right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.\n",
      "55706 (to Amanda) I get pedicures!\n",
      "55728 Hold on! There is something different.\n",
      "55730 Was that place... The Sun?\n",
      "55732 Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!\n",
      "55740 How was your date with Joey?\n",
      "55742 You didn't like that?\n",
      "55794 If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!\n",
      "55800 Well, aren't you a treat.\n",
      "55823 That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!\n",
      "55825 Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...\n",
      "55828 Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.\n",
      "55829 I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)\n",
      "55848 Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.\n",
      "55850 I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.\n",
      "55853 No, I just had to get a picture of this.\n",
      "55854 I see you later!\n",
      "55857 Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.\n",
      "55865 Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!\n",
      "55868 There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...\n",
      "55873 Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...\n",
      "55902 Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?\n",
      "55904 Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.\n",
      "55919 I know, what are we gonna do?\n",
      "55921 I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!\n",
      "55982 To be fair this one does have nuts.\n",
      "55986 Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?\n",
      "55988 We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)\n",
      "55994 Was that Emma? Is she up?\n",
      "55999 I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!\n",
      "56002 To the bathroom!\n",
      "56005 (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)\n",
      "56021 You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?\n",
      "56041 I'm begging you stop.\n",
      "56045 (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!\n",
      "56048 Thats a bear.\n",
      "56052 Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!\n",
      "56057 I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?\n",
      "56063 They left.\n",
      "56081 I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?\n",
      "56083 Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.\n",
      "56084 Ooh! That's my girl!\n",
      "56086 Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?\n",
      "56088 Me too...\n",
      "56089 There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?\n",
      "56091 I was kidding.\n",
      "56094 No, not yet.\n",
      "56102 Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.\n",
      "56104 Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)\n",
      "56113 Let's do it, come on!\n",
      "56131 Thanks!\n",
      "56134 Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.\n",
      "56141 So excited about your letter!\n",
      "56149 So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?\n",
      "56154 That's where people make number two!!\n",
      "56232 (reading) I donâ€™t... uh... understand.\n",
      "56236 On every word?\n",
      "56240 And that became â€˜they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?\n",
      "56245 You know what? You donâ€™t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.\n",
      "56275 I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.\n",
      "56278 Word!\n",
      "56288 She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?\n",
      "56292 Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!\n",
      "56302 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?\n",
      "56330 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?\n",
      "56334 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?\n",
      "56339 It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)\n",
      "56341 (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).\n",
      "56343 (Still looks confused) They loved it.\n",
      "56345 They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.\n",
      "56347 She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.\n",
      "56351 That sounds like fun.\n",
      "56361 I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!\n",
      "56370 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?\n",
      "56381 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!\n",
      "56477 Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.\n",
      "56480 (he enters) Hey honey!\n",
      "56482 Is Monica not here?\n",
      "56484 Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!\n",
      "56486 Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!\n",
      "56488 Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.\n",
      "56490 First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.\n",
      "56492 Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?\n",
      "56531 Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.\n",
      "56535 Joe...\n",
      "56537 Fine!\n",
      "56539 Work, Joe!\n",
      "56541 What am I gonna do now?\n",
      "56543 He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!\n",
      "56545 That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).\n",
      "56596 Hey Joe!\n",
      "56598 Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.\n",
      "56600 (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.\n",
      "56602 (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!\n",
      "56604 (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!\n",
      "56606 I'm not lying to you, I watched it!\n",
      "56608 I watched it!\n",
      "56610 (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!\n",
      "56612 (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)\n",
      "56614 (In a sarcastic \"of course not\"!-tone) No!\n",
      "56639 I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!\n",
      "56641 What did I just say?\n",
      "56643 Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...\n",
      "56645 Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?\n",
      "56651 He really is a chameleon.\n",
      "56705 Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.\n",
      "56707 I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?\n",
      "56711 Lying is wrong!\n",
      "56713 I'm a pretty little girl.\n",
      "56758 That's funny, we were doing the same thing!\n",
      "56761 Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.\n",
      "56763 It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.\n",
      "56772 (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!\n",
      "56775 Hey!\n",
      "56777 Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.\n",
      "56779 You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!\n",
      "56781 Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.\n",
      "56784 (pointing at himself) Little people?\n",
      "56787 What...? NO!\n",
      "56789 (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!\n",
      "56791 I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.\n",
      "56837 Ok, ok, here we go.\n",
      "56839 Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)\n",
      "56852 But you already gave all your money to charity!\n",
      "56854 I donâ€™t think you can do that!\n",
      "56856 Thatâ€™s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.\n",
      "56893 Oh, because we love kids. Love â€˜em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.\n",
      "56898 But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.\n",
      "56900 What?\n",
      "56906 Of course it was!\n",
      "56908 RAT BASTARD!\n",
      "56914 Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.\n",
      "56930 (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!\n",
      "56932 Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on the door again)\n",
      "56936 WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!\n",
      "56939 Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.\n",
      "56941 (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!\n",
      "56954 What the hell are you doing?\n",
      "56956 Well, we're not.\n",
      "56958 We don't have a code word.\n",
      "56962 Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)\n",
      "56965 (escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.\n",
      "56967 Ok!\n",
      "56968 What?\n",
      "56971 And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)\n",
      "56975 I can explain... Joey...\n",
      "56988 Oh, that's really ok.\n",
      "57011 Wrong number?\n",
      "57013 That's great!\n",
      "57015 Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?\n",
      "57034 Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.\n",
      "57038 Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.\n",
      "57040 No, no! We made this decision together.\n",
      "57052 Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!\n",
      "57054 We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?\n",
      "57083 Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?\n",
      "57085 You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!\n",
      "57087 Somebody is gonna pick us.\n",
      "57089 I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!\n",
      "57091 (after a long pause) \"The Firm\"?\n",
      "57093 You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.\n",
      "57095 I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".\n",
      "57097 Tell me more.\n",
      "57099 You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!\n",
      "57104 Oh my God!\n",
      "57109 Hmm, the game's at one.\n",
      "57111 Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.\n",
      "57113 You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.\n",
      "57115 Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!\n",
      "57118 Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!\n",
      "57159 I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!\n",
      "57202 (peeping) They're out there!\n",
      "57204 (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!\n",
      "57206 (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.\n",
      "57231 Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?\n",
      "57233 (relieved) Oh thank God!\n",
      "57235 (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.\n",
      "57246 Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)\n",
      "57249 HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!\n",
      "57251 Please let me stay on this side of the door.\n",
      "57261 The cranberries...?\n",
      "57264 He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)\n",
      "57269 The floating heads do make a good point.\n",
      "57282 Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.\n",
      "57288 That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.\n",
      "57305 A little late for that.\n",
      "57308 Uhm, we've got turkey grease.\n",
      "57318 Can you ever feel your ears?\n",
      "57321 (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!\n",
      "57332 Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!\n",
      "57335 Come on guys, PUSH!\n",
      "57338 My cranberries!\n",
      "57340 Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!\n",
      "57341 (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!\n",
      "57343 What's going on?\n",
      "57345 And?\n",
      "57347 Are you serious? (they hug)\n",

      "57486 Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!\n",
      "57491 Yeah, wow.\n",
      "57495 No-ot for me it doesnâ€™t.\n",
      "57499 Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?\n",

      "57679 Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!\n",
      "57681 Itâ€™s perfect. Itâ€™s everything weâ€™ve been looking for.\n",
      "57683 And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said?\n",
      "57685 And the fireplace in the bedroom.\n",
      "57687 This is bringing out a lovely color in you!\n",
      "57689 I donâ€™t know. What do you think?\n",
      "57691 I do too.\n",
      "57693 I know.\n",
      "57695 I donâ€™t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancyâ€™s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.\n",
      "57697 We donâ€™t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.\n",
      "57699 I know. Gooooood luck with it.\n",
      "57727 Hey!\n",
      "57729 Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?\n",
      "57734 Yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.\n",
      "57746 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.\n",
      "57752 Actually, we already found a house we love.\n",
      "57755 Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?\n",
      "57760 I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.\n",
      "57762 (goes towards Joey) You know that's not the reason Joe. (Joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. He goes back to where he was standing before)\n",
      "57776 Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!\n",
      "57794 If you win, we give up the birds.\n",
      "57796 But if we win, we get your apartment.\n",
      "57803 Dangerous Liaisons.\n",
      "57808 Fancy.\n",
      "57810 Fancy guest.\n",
      "57817 Thanks man.\n",
      "57836 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!\n",
      "57838 (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)\n",
      "57842 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.\n",
      "57845 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.\n",
      "57863 (entering) Hey.\n",
      "57865 I know. (He kisses her.)\n",
      "57867 No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)\n",
      "57869 Sure!\n",
      "57871 Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",
      "57875 Here, here!\n",
      "57881 Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.\n",
      "57883 (to Nancy) Okay, thanks... (to Monica) They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.\n",
      "57885 I know.\n",
      "57894 That's okay, we understand.\n",
      "57897 Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.\n",
      "57899 We got the house.\n",
      "57901 I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.\n",
      "57903 We're getting the house. (they hug) We're getting the house.\n",
      "57905 We're growing up.\n",
      "57907 So who's gonna tell them?\n",
      "57909 Not it! Damn it!\n",
      "57912 You'll see.\n",
      "57920 Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.\n",
      "57935 What did I marry into?\n",
      "57943 You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!\n",
      "57948 (to Monica) I'm leaving you.\n",
      "57950 Who?\n",
      "57952 (looking around) Did I go to this school?\n",
      "57954 (looks over at her) Sure, nice.\n",
      "57956 You're right, by saying \"nice\" I'm virtually licking her.\n",
      "57958 Are you asking permission to break the pact?\n",
      "57961 Awesome, the name really stands out.\n",
      "57963 Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!\n",
      "57965 Hey!\n",
      "57967 You know, our band is playing on Friday.\n",
      "57972 Fresh!\n",
      "57974 Mint!\n",
      "57976 I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.\n",
      "57978 I said it first, bro.\n",
      "57980 (angrily) Look, if you did...\n",
      "57982 Totally. I had sex in High school...\n",
      "57984 All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.\n",
      "57986 All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.\n",
      "57988 Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.\n",
      "57990 Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.\n",
      "57992 Your hands are shaking.\n",
      "58114 (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!\n",
      "58116 Ross, that was 16 years ago!\n",
      "58118 I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.\n",
      "58120 Oh really?\n",
      "58122 Oh really!?\n",
      "58124 ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)\n",
      "58128 Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.\n",
      "58130 Really?\n",
      "58140 Aren't you...?\n",
      "58142 (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?\n",
      "58144 Hi Monica.\n",
      "58146 O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)\n",
      "58154 Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: \"Betrayal In The Common Room\".\n",
      "58156 Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.\n",
      "58158 (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..\n",
      "58160 (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?\n",
      "58162 Not her!\n",
      "58165 Soo... you girls having fun?\n",
      "58170 Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.\n",
      "58172 Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.\n",
      "58174 So where are you applying to?\n",
      "58176 I'm in college and I'm in a band.\n",
      "58228 Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.\n",
      "58230 Why?\n",
      "58232 You kissed her that night too?\n",
      "58234 Seriously, where did this happen?\n",
      "58236 Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?\n",
      "58238 I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.\n",
      "58240 Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?\n",
      "58251 What did I marry into?\n",
      "58289 Hey!\n",
      "58291 You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.\n",
      "58293 No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.\n",
      "58313 (to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.\n",
      "58320 Heh.\n",
      "58326 This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!\n",
      "58328 Thank you.\n",
      "58335 I know, I hate being left out of things.\n",
      "58338 Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.\n",
      "58340 What happened?\n",
      "58344 (standing up too) M-Me-me-me!\n",
      "58346 Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.\n",
      "58350 Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!\n",
      "58352 You are going downer!\n",
      "58354 (almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)\n",
      "58366 Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.\n",
      "58368 Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.\n",
      "58430 Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!\n",
      "58432 Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.\n",
      "58434 (Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make \"groom\" for Chandler.\n",
      "58446 How's it going?\n",
      "58448 (smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.\n",
      "58450 You too.\n",
      "58452 Me too.\n",
      "58454 I'm not supposed to tell you.\n",
      "58456 You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)\n",
      "58459 Rach, Rach, knock knock.\n",
      "58461 I'll tell you at the wedding.\n",
      "58503 So technically, would this person be in the wedding?\n",
      "58507 I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.\n",
      "58517 (quickly) I'll do it.\n",
      "58519 (to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...\n",
      "58531 (to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?\n",
      "58533 Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)\n",
      "58538 Ready?\n",
      "58540 Okay.\n",
      "58542 Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?\n",
      "58544 You look beautiful.\n",
      "58563 That really was an incredible wedding.\n",
      "58565 I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.\n",
      "58567 I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.\n",
      "58575 So, where's Mike?\n",
      "58589 Hey.\n",
      "58591 Why are you wearing my apron?\n",
      "58593 Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as \"my wife\" and \"the woman who's carrying my child\"? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?\n",
      "58606 Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes \"Mooooo\"!\n",
      "58614 I'm so sorry...\n",
      "58649 Monica. Calm, self.\n",
      "58652 Why would you say that?\n",
      "58657 Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.\n",
      "58747 (enters the room wearing an \"I love New York\" t-shirt, a \"Statue of Liberty\" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!\n",
      "58749 Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.\n",
      "58754 Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?\n",
      "58756 That's great.\n",
      "58760 So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?\n",
      "58764 I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.\n",
      "58766 Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)\n",
      "58768 Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.\n",
      "58770 I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.\n",
      "58772 I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?\n",
      "58774 Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!\n",
      "58812 Hey! How was lunch?\n",
      "58814 (struggling) Oh, really?\n",
      "58816 O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?\n",
      "58818 Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?\n",
      "58820 How do you know?\n",
      "58822 Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?\n",
      "58824 (nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!\n",
      "58889 Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.\n",
      "58891 You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)\n",
      "58895 A dinosaur died a million years ago?\n",
      "58916 YOU NEVER DID IT!\n",
      "58918 Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.\n",
      "58923 Mrs Hannigan?\n",
      "58926 Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?\n",
      "58929 Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.\n",
      "58933 Damn it.\n",
      "58991 That's what we were gonna name the baby.\n",
      "58998 Hey, how'd the interview go?\n",
      "59000 You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.\n",
      "59002 That is a bad interview.\n",
      "59013 Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!\n",
      "59024 To Ross!\n",
      "59036 And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.\n",
      "59040 What?\n",
      "59048 When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?\n",
      "59139 Man, those two dogs are going at it!\n",
      "59141 Hey.\n",
      "59144 Really? What changed your mind?\n",
      "59146 Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.\n",
      "59148 Ha! I'm just messing with you.\n",
      "59152 You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?\n",
      "59183 It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!\n",
      "59186 Excuse me?\n",
      "59188 For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.\n",
      "59196 How did the job stuff go?\n",
      "59198 That's great!\n",
      "59208 How did the job stuff go?\n",
      "59214 Or facing a bitch of a commute.\n",
      "59218 My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica looks at him and can't really place what he just said)\n",
      "59238 Well, it makes me feel sad, but...\n",
      "59240 I see.\n",
      "59245 Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?\n",
      "59250 We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.\n",
      "59252 What do you think Pheebs?\n",
      "59254 Yeah.\n",
      "59256 You're kidding!\n",
      "59259 Oh yeah?\n",
      "59262 I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.\n",
      "59267 Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.\n",
      "59329 It feels like weâ€™re cheating on our house. And if weâ€™re gonna cheat, shouldnâ€™t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house wonâ€™t do?\n",
      "59348 And yet I never run into Beyonce!\n",
      "59351 (at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)\n",
      "59353 (To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?\n",
      "59356 This can not be happening!\n",
      "59358 The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.\n",
      "59360 That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?\n",
      "59362 Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.\n",
      "59364 Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) \"Oh My God\"!\n",
      "59366 (looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his index finger like Monica did)\n",
      "59392 The Hitlers will be so disappointed.\n",
      "59394 Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.\n",
      "59396 Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.\n",
      "59398 I never stopped loving you.\n",
      "59400 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.\n",
      "59402 Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.\n",
      "59404 (stunned) Obviously.\n",
      "59406 Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.\n",
      "59408 I understand.\n",
      "59410 (speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.\n",
      "59448 Hey!\n",
      "59450 So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.\n",

      "59557 Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!\n",

      "59610 Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.\n",

      "59739 So, ah... Any plans for the summer?\n",
      "59741 Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?\n",
      "59743 Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.\n",
      "59744 One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.\n",

      "59848 Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.\n",

      "60045 Really? You got us a chick and a duck?\n",
      "60048 Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.\n",
      "60050 Alright.\n",
      "60053 It's okay, it's just an egg roll.\n",

      "60071 I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.\n",
      "60073 No... It's all glued together.\n",
      "60075 I don't know. Maybe.\n",
      "60077 I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.\n",
      "60079 Did that movie ever get made?\n",
      "60129 And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.\n",
      "60131 What's the matter?\n",
      "60133 I understand.\n",
      "60135 I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.\n",
      "60137 Well, I can't do it either.\n",
      "60140 We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!\n",
      "60183 That was... Impressive.\n",
      "60186 Sorry about the table, man.\n",
      "60188 You gonna buy a new one?\n",
      "60190 Well, at least we got these little guys out.\n",
      "60192 Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?\n",
      "60194 Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.\n",
      "60196 Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.\n",
      "60198 You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.\n",
      "60200 I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?\n",

      "60275 (to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!\n",

      "91 Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.\n",
      "92 You got waaaay too much free time.\n",
      "93 Happy birthday, pal!\n",
      "94 Well, aren't we Mr. \"The glass is half empty.\"\n",
      "95 Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?\n",
      "96  Huh? Huh? Huh?\n",
      "97  I have no idea.\n",
      "98 You got it.\n",
      "99  Oh, this is not that bad.\n",
      "100 ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! \n",
      "101 We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.\n",
      "102 Yes, Bunny?\n",
      "103  Could've been a peach.\n",
      "104 What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?\n",
      "105  See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.\n",
      "106 He's open!\n",
      "107 Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!\n",
      "108 'Scuse me.\n",
      "109 Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. \n",
      "110 Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Ba-!\n",
      "111 Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?\n",
      "112 Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?\n",
      "113 Then what?\n",
      "114 So in your whole life, you've only been with oneÂ—Â—oh.\n",
      "115 I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...\n",
      "116 No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. \n",
      "117 Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.\n",
      "118 You gotta do it, man.\n",
      "119 Thanks. \n",
      "120 Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.\n",
      "121 Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.\n",
      "122 To the left, to the left- aww! \n",
      "123 We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.\n",
      "124 So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!\n",
      "125 Not a one.\n",
      "126 Oh, right, right, shut up.\n",
      "127 No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.\n",
      "128 Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.\n",
      "129 Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.\n",
      "130 Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?\n",
      "131 It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.\n",
      "132 Yuh-huh.\n",
      "133 Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearÂ—you want it to be dirty?\n",
      "134 Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?\n",
      "135 There you go.\n",
      "136 Where are they? Where are they?\n",
      "137 It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.\n",
      "138 Here we go.\n",
      "139 Hey, Janice.\n",
      "140 Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?\n",
      "141 What?\n",
      "142  What... did you get me there?\n",
      "143 Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.\n",
      "144 That's great.\n",
      "145 Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?\n",
      "146 That's it?\n",
      "147 Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.\n",
      "148 Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.\n",
      "149 Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.\n",
      "150 Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?\n",
      "151  I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.\n",
      "152 Oh, I don't know, a million?\n",
      "153 I'm fine.\n",
      "154 I'm not fine. Here she comes.\n",
      "155 How do you do that?\n",
      "156 We should always always break up together.\n",
      "157 I'm free! I'm free!\n",
      "158 You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...\n",
      "159  Ross, ten o'clock.\n",
      "160 No, ten o'clock.\n",
      "161  There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!\n",
      "162 She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!\n",
      "163 Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'\n",
      "164 Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.\n",
      "165 Thank you, buddy.\n",
      "166 Y'think?\n",
      "167 Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...\n",
      "168 Here goes. \n",
      "169 Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.\n",
      "170 Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. \n",
      "171 \n",
      "172 Hey, kids.\n",
      "173 Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.\n",
      "174 It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...\n",
      "175 Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.\n",
      "176 Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?\n",
      "177 Who's Rick?\n",
      "178 Oh, so you're divorced?\n",
      "179 Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?\n",
      "180 So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?\n",
      "181 Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?\n",
      "182 So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?\n",
      "183 ...Hm.\n",
      "184 What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?\n",
      "185 Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!\n",
      "186 Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.\n",
      "187 Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.\n",
      "188 Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...\n",
      "189 Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.\n",
      "190 Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.\n",
      "191 C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!\n",
      "192 Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.\n",
      "193 Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. \n",
      "194 No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? \n",
      "195 God, I love these fingers...\n",
      "196 No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.\n",
      "197 Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. \n",
      "198 Don't go.\n",
      "199  Too bad, she's leaving.\n",
      "200 Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.\n",
      "201 What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!\n",
      "202 I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?\n",
      "203 Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?\n",
      "204 Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.\n",
      "205 You.\n",
      "206 Nono, just you.\n",
      "207 Lose the other guys.\n",
      "208 C'mon, we're great together, why not?\n",
      "209 ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'\n",
      "210 I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...\n",
      "211 ...The second guy.\n",
      "212 Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.\n",
      "213  \"Big guy?\"\n",
      "214 Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.\n",
      "215 Oh, great. This is just...\n",
      "216 Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.\n",
      "217 She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!\n",
      "218 Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.\n",
      "219 Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.\n",
      "220 Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!\n",
      "221 There you go!\n",
      "222 You're definitely scaring here.\n",
      "223 Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. \n",
      "224 Hey, it's me.\n",
      "225 Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.\n",
      "226 I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!\n",
      "227  Put Joey on the phone.\n",
      "228 I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.\n",
      "229 Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.\n",
      "230 Um, is it sugarless?\n",
      "231 Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.\n",
      "232 You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.\n",
      "233  Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.\n",
      "234 Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. \n",
      "235 Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.\n",
      "236  Yes... thank you. That was... that was....\n",
      "237 OK.\n",
      "238 Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.\n",
      "239 Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.\n",
      "240 Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?\n",
      "241 Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...\n",
      "242 Yes please.\n",
      "243 He's a he?\n",
      "244 ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?\n",
      "245 You did?\n",
      "246 Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?\n",
      "247 You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?\n",
      "248 Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?\n",
      "249 Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?\n",
      "250 WHAT IS IT?!\n",
      "251 Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.\n",
      "252 I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?\n",
      "253 Hey, gorgeous.\n",
      "254 No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.\n",
      "255 So, uh... what do you think it is about me?\n",
      "256 ...Quality, right, great.\n",
      "257 Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?\n",
      "258 Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.\n",
      "259 No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.\n",
      "260 Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.\n",
      "261 Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?\n",
      "262 Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.\n",
      "263 You're watching a football game at a funeral?\n",
      "264 You are a frightening, frightening man.\n",
      "265 Oh, no-\n",
      "266 Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.\n",
      "267 Hey.\n",
      "268 Who are those people?\n",
      "269 Hey, Lowell.\n",
      "270 So how's it going there in Financial Services?\n",
      "271 Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.\n",
      "272 Really.\n",
      "273 So- you can tell?\n",
      "274 So you don't think I have a, a quality?\n",
      "275 He is?\n",
      "276 Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian.\n",
      "277 Hey.\n",
      "278 And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?\n",
      "279 That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.\n",
      "280 Do you know which one you're gonna be?\n",
      "281 Good luck, man. I hope you get it.\n",
      "282 Yes, every single one of them.\n",
      "283 I thought it was $98.50.\n",
      "284 I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.\n",
      "285 All right, I'm nine years old.\n",
      "286 We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.\n",
      "287 Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.\n",
      "288 Tonight, on a very special Blossom.\n",
      "289 Oh, you must stop shooping.\n",
      "290 No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.\n",
      "291 Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.\n",
      "292 The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.\n",
      "293 No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?\n",
      "294 Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?\n",
      "295 Do either of you have the keys?\n",
      "296  For an emergency just like this.\n",
      "297 Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.\n",
      "298 Now this feels like Thanksgiving.\n",
      "299 Shall I carve?\n",
      "300 Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?\n",
      "301 I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",
      "302 Here, here!\n",
      "303 Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!\n",
      "304 Might wanna open with the snowman.\n",
      "305 Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!\n",
      "306 It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.\n",
      "307 Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.\n",
      "308  That guy's going home with a note!\n",
      "309 Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.\n",
      "310 Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.\n",
      "311 I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.\n",
      "312 I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\n",
      "313 Too many jokes... must mock Joey!\n",
      "314 Aah, y'killing me!\n",
      "315 Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\n",
      "316 Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\n",
      "317 Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?\n",
      "318 I happen to know a Fun Bob.\n",
      "319 That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.\n",
      "320 Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.\n",
      "321 With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.\n",
      "322 Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...\n",
      "323 You remember Janice.\n",
      "324  But you found me!\n",
      "325 Kill me. Kill me now.\n",
      "326 Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-\n",
      "327 I'm sorry you misunderstood...\n",
      "328 Oh, will you give me the thing. \n",
      "329 \n",
      "330 Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.\n",
      "331 And the moment of joy is upon us.\n",
      "332 Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. \n",
      "333 Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!\n",
      "334 Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?\n",
      "335 Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.\n",
      "336 Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?\n",
      "337 Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'\n",
      "338 You can say that because she's not your mom.\n",
      "339 Shhh, busy beaming with pride.\n",
      "340 Now why would she say that's embarrassing?\n",
      "341 THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!\n",
      "342 This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.\n",
      "343 ...And then he burst into flames.\n",
      "344 Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.\n",
      "345 Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.\n",
      "346 I know I am.\n",
      "347 Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
      "348 What are you guys doing out here?\n",
      "349 Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. \n",
      "350 Oh my God.\n",
      "351 I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?\n",
      "352 What?\n",
      "353  You knew about this?\n",
      "354 I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!\n",
      "355  I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?\n",
      "356 Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.\n",
      "357 I can't believe you did this. \n",
      "358 I'm still mad at you for not telling me.\n",
      "359 You gotta let me slam the door! \n",
      "360 What was that?\n",
      "361 Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? \n",
      "362 Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.\n",
      "363 Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!\n",
      "364 That's very funny. We done now?\n",
      "365 That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.\n",
      "366 No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.\n",
      "367 You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.\n",
      "368 Really stupid.\n",
      "369 Yeah. No. No...\n",
      "370 Yeah, okay.\n",
      "371 Nice save.\n",
      "372 Hey.\n",
      "373 Yeah, why not.  So I told her.\n",
      "374 Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.\n",
      "375 Pretty good! I told her.\n",
      "376 No-no-no-no, we're done.\n",
      "377 And, we're done with the yogurt. \n",
      "378  Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!\n",
      "379 Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!\n",
      "380 You think?\n",
      "381 Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?\n",
      "382 What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!\n",
      "383 Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio\n",
      "384 Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.\n",
      "385 What do you mean, like, buy it together?\n",
      "386 You think we're ready for something like that?\n",
      "387 Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?\n",
      "388 I'm not moving out.\n",
      "389 Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...\n",
      "390 It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.\n",
      "391 Aw, don't do that\n",
      "392 Fine. \n",
      "393 More coffee over here, please!\n",
      "394 So what are you gonna do?\n",
      "395 Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.\n",
      "396 That's patio furniture!\n",
      "397  What about the birds?\n",
      "398 You pick one.\n",
      "399 Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!\n",
      "400 Not like that, I won't! \n",
      "401 So, what do you think?\n",
      "402 I know!\n",
      "403 What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!\n",
      "404 My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! \n",
      "405 Wha-\n",
      "406 Hey!\n",
      "407 Yeah, get out!\n",
      "408  One more game?\n",
      "409 I'm sorry!\n",
      "410 Rachel, wait, wait.\n",
      "411 Can I just say one thing?\n",
      "412 That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.\n",
      "413 Oh, yes, could I have one of those. \n",
      "414 Okay.\n",
      "415 No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.\n",
      "416 It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.\n",
      "417 Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.\n",
      "418 Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.\n",
      "419 Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?\n",
      "420 Huh.\n",
      "421 Uhhuh, how did you know that?\n",
      "422  What?\n",
      "423 Y'know, I don't see that happening?\n",
      "424 Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'\n",
      "425  Oh, good. Rog is here.\n",
      "426 Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.\n",
      "427 Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.\n",
      "428 Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?\n",
      "429 Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.\n",
      "430 So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?\n",
      "431 C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \"No thanks, it's late.\"\n",
      "432 Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?\n",
      "433 Well, you're gonna.\n",
      "434 Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\n",
      "435 Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\n",
      "436 No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I'm married.\"\n",
      "437 Yeah. I really do.\n",
      "438 Get off!\n",
      "439  What? What?\n",
      "440 Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.\n",
      "441 Basically we just feel that he's...\n",
      "442 Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.\n",
      "443 If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.\n",
      "444 Any contact?\n",
      "445 Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÂ—I don't think we need a third...\n",
      "446 I think it's winning.\n",
      "447 She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.\n",
      "448 No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.\n",
      "449 Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...\n",
      "450 Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...\n",
      "451 Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?\n",
      "452 Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.\n",
      "453 ...And what did you bring?\n",
      "454 Janice?\n",
      "455  Hey, it's Janice.\n",
      "456 Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.\n",
      "457 Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!\n",
      "458 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!\n",
      "459 That's OK.\n",
      "460  What? What can't you do?\n",
      "461 Tell me it's \"you and me\" we.\n",
      "462 Ok, you can not do this to me.\n",
      "463 I hope she throws up on you.\n",
      "464 So...\n",
      "465 Oh, what a crappy night!\n",
      "466 Excuse me.  How ya doin'?\n",
      "467 Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?\n",
      "468 You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?\n",
      "469 That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...\n",
      "470 No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.\n",
      "471 Ok, well, this was very special.\n",
      "472 Janice is gonna go away now.\n",
      "473 Oh, good, Joey's home now.\n",
      "474 How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?\n",
      "475 Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.\n",
      "476 Hi, Just Janice.\n",
      "477 Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.\n",
      "478 Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.\n",
      "479  It is?\n",
      "480 Oh no, you see, actually it is.\n",
      "481 Oh, no I don't.\n",
      "482 I did, but...\n",
      "483 Call me!\n",
      "484 Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.\n",
      "485 Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.\n",
      "486 Hey!\n",
      "487 So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.\n",
      "488 So.... I quit.\n",
      "489 Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!\n",
      "490 If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.\n",
      "491 It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.\n",
      "492 Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.\n",
      "493 I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.\n",
      "494 Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.\n",
      "495 Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.\n",
      "496 Can you see my nipples through this shirt?\n",
      "497 Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the \"a-gogo.\"\n",
      "498 Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.\n",
      "499 Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.\n",
      "500 Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?\n",
      "501 Who are you going out with?\n",
      "502 And he's not speaking metaphorically.\n",
      "503 Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  \"You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.\"\n",
      "504 Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.\n",
      "505 Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.\n",
      "506  Well.... it is amouz-ing...\n",
      "507 You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. \n",
      "508 ....with??\n",
      "509 It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.\n",
      "510 Again?\n",
      "511 \n",
      "512 Well?\n",
      "513 Look at this! \n",
      "514 Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...\n",
      "515  OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.\n",
      "516 This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?\n",
      "517 Thank you Helen, that'll be all.\n",
      "518 Last time I do that, I promise.\n",
      "519  Whooooaaaa....\n",
      "520 What are you crazy? That's a baby!\n",
      "521 Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.\n",
      "522 Well, only if you order stuff.\n",
      "523 There it is! So what're you gonna do?\n",
      "524 And your friend Phoebe?\n",
      "525 Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.\n",
      "526 Alright, what have we learned so far?\n",
      "527  \"Happy Birthday Peehe.\"\n",
      "528 Did you see Betty?\n",
      "529 Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.\n",
      "530 Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.\n",
      "531 You know, you think I would.\n",
      "532 What's up with the simian?\n",
      "533 Okay...  ..whose turn is it?\n",
      "534 No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.\n",
      "535 Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.\n",
      "536 We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'\n",
      "537  So, you feel like a dad yet?\n",
      "538 Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.\n",
      "539 Pudo aver sido General Tso! \n",
      "540 Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.\n",
      "541 You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?\n",
      "542 Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?\n",
      "543 ...little playthings with yarn?\n",
      "544 Could you want her more?\n",
      "545  Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.\n",
      "546 We're notÂ—we're not saying anything.\n",
      "547  We were playing poker, alright...\n",
      "548 And then he did.\n",
      "549 There just don't happen to be any women in our games.\n",
      "550  OK, so now we draw cards.\n",
      "551 OK Phoebs, how many do you want?\n",
      "552  OK, so at this point, the dealer...\n",
      "553 OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Alright babe, deal the cards.\n",
      "554 Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.\n",
      "555 The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...\n",
      "556 Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.\n",
      "557 Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?\n",
      "558 Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : \"When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!\"\n",
      "559 Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?\n",
      "560 Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?\n",
      "561 That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.\n",
      "562 Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!\n",
      "563 Couldn't be more out. \n",
      "564 Y'know, I've had dates like this.\n",
      "565 Call.\n",
      "566 : What do you need, what do you need?\n",
      "567 Alright, here's ten. \n",
      "568 Good luck.\n",
      "569 : I thought we had them!\n",
      "570 Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!\n",
      "571 Go.\n",
      "572 Toootal chick-flick.\n",
      "573 They're still just friends, right?\n",
      "574 I can't believe we are even having this discussion.\n",
      "575 I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?\n",
      "576 I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.\n",
      "577 Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.\n",
      "578 Rachel lost Marcel.\n",
      "579 Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.\n",
      "580 Marcel?\n",
      "581 Marcel?\n",
      "582 Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...\n",
      "583 Yes have you seen any?\n",
      "584 Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.\n",
      "585 Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.\n",
      "586 Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.\n",
      "587 Marcel?!\n",
      "588 Eh. I thought that was an alp.\n",
      "589 Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.\n",
      "590 I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.\n",
      "591 I feel violated. And not in a good way.\n",
      "592 I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...\n",
      "593 Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I'm right, right?\n",
      "594 Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.\n",
      "595 No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.\n",
      "596 Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \"Yes indeedy-o.\"\n",
      "597  And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.\n",
      "598 Hey Rach!\n",
      "599 Yes!\n",
      "600 I have my reasons.\n",
      "601  Oh God!\n",
      "602 Hey, I've been honing!\n",
      "603 Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.\n",
      "604 What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.\n",
      "605 Can I use your phone?\n",
      "606 Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?\n",
      "607 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...\n",
      "608 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.\n",
      "609 She answered.\n",
      "610 I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.\n",
      "611 If it helps, I could slide over.\n",
      "612 Hello? Hello?\n",
      "613 So how's Mindy?\n",
      "614 Hell is filled with people like you.\n",
      "615 ...And boogie!\n",
      "616 Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?\n",
      "617 Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?\n",
      "618 I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.\n",
      "619 No!  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...\n",
      "620 'S'why I'm dancing...\n",
      "621 Ring dammit, ring!\n",
      "622 What?!\n",
      "623  I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!\n",
      "624 Nngghhh!!!!!!!\n",
      "625 Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.\n",
      "626 What are you doing here?\n",
      "627 ...I'm, I'm okay.\n",
      "628 That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...\n",
      "629 Okay.\n",
      "630 ...I dunno.\n",
      "631 Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?\n",
      "632 Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.\n",
      "633 Well, that's what we said about Joey...\n",
      "634 How about Joey... Pepponi?\n",
      "635 Joey... Switzerland?\n",
      "636 Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?\n",
      "637 Well, it does not ring a bell with me...\n",
      "638 Might wanna try Joseph.\n",
      "639 Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.\n",
      "640 She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?\n",
      "641 So what does this mean?\n",
      "642 I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?\n",
      "643 I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.\n",
      "644 Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.\n",
      "645 What?\n",
      "646 Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.\n",
      "647 ...Take off their hats!\n",
      "648 You're kidding.\n",
      "649 Y'know, you'd think I would've.\n",
      "650 ...He's in.\n",
      "651 Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.\n",
      "652 Tell me what?\n",
      "653  Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.\n",
      "654 Wow!\n",
      "655 More importantly, was I any good?\n",
      "656 Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. \n",

      "812 I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.\n",
      "813 Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.\n",
      "814 Nope, not this time.\n",
      "815 I'm not yanking you.\n",
      "816 Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.\n",

      "824 Well, there you go.\n",

      "827 Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!\n",

      "837 Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.\n",
      "838 And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....\n",
      "839 I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!\n",
      "840 You said...\n",
      "841 What are you guys doing together?\n",
      "842 Really.\n",

      "845 Well, I guess that's something.\n",
      "846 Okay.\n",
      "847 Oh God!\n",
      "848 Really?\n",
      "849 Taste it.\n",
      "850 Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.\n",
      "851 Hey, mister tux!\n",
      "852  Get up.\n",
      "853 You're in my seat.\n",
      "854 'Cause I was sitting there.\n",
      "855 Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.\n",
      "856 The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.\n",
      "857 All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal.  GET UP!!\n",
      "858 Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.\n",
      "859 Really!\n",
      "860 Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.\n",
      "861 You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. \n",
      "862 Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.\n",
      "863 All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo, comfortable.\n",
      "864 All right! \n",
      "865 All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! \n",
      "866 Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.\n",
      "867 All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, \"Get out of my chair, dillhole!\"\n",
      "868 What are you doing?\n",
      "869 The cushions are the essence of the chair!\n",
      "870 Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.\n",
      "871 We used them as pillows when we went camping.\n",
      "872  The sheep.\n",
      "873 He took my essence!\n",
      "874 Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.\n",
      "875 What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?\n",
      "876 He's got nothing!\n",
      "877 What are you supporting?\n",
      "878 Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.\n",
      "879  You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?\n",
      "880 They got a phone in there, right?\n",
      "881 Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that? \n",
      "882 Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!\n",
      "883 Oooo-ooh!\n",
      "884 Jeez, what a baby.\n",
      "885 Stop it. Stop it! \n",
      "886 Excuse me. Hi.\n",
      "887 Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.\n",
      "888 I mean, I was sitting there.\n",
      "889 But, I never left the room!\n",
      "890 All right, that's it, give me your underwear.\n",
      "891  See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.\n",
      "892 Hey.\n",
      "893 Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.\n",
      "894 Because the kids need new shoes.\n",
      "895 Do I look fat?\n",
      "896 Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.\n",
      "897 Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....\n",
      "898 Okay, so you both just know this stuff?\n",
      "899 That's easy, baggage claim.\n",
      "900 Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.\n",
      "901 Thank you Rachel.\n",
      "902 Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.\n",
      "903 Yeah. \n",
      "904 Yeah.\n",
      "905 Okay, the old hug and roll.\n",
      "906 Okay, one question.\n",
      "907 You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?\n",
      "908 Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.\n",
      "909 Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked \n",
      "910 Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.\n",
      "911 That, that's what's stupid.\n",
      "912 Night-night.....Janice. \n",
      "913 No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.\n",
      "914 You mean there's more than one of us.\n",
      "915 And that's how you bought it?\n",
      "916 Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.\n",
      "917 Sure. What's up?\n",
      "918 You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!\n",
      "919 Well, it's official there are no good movies.\n",
      "920 Hey, man. What's up?\n",
      "921 Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.\n",
      "922 Is anybody else scared?\n",
      "923 Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!\n",
      "924  Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.\n",
      "925 Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.\n",
      "926 Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.\n",
      "927 Noo.\n",
      "928 No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'\n",
      "929 I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.\n",
      "930 Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!\n",
      "931 Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?\n",
      "932 You think?\n",
      "933 Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.\n",
      "934 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. \n",
      "935 Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.\n",
      "936 Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.\n",
      "937 Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.\n",
      "938 Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!\n",
      "939 I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.\n",
      "940 It doesn't scare me!\n",
      "941 Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! \n",
      "942 So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.\n",
      "943 Then I got all needy and clingy.\n",
      "944 She said she'd call me.\n",
      "945 Oh God.\n",
      "946 This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.\n",
      "947 So, you don't think I'm terminal?\n",
      "948 Okay, okay. So, should I call her?\n",
      "949 So I'm not, not gonna lose her?\n",
      "950 I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'\n",
      "951  Hello, Janice.\n",
      "952  Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?\n",
      "953  No. Not anymore.\n",
      "954 Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. \n",
      "955 Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.\n",
      "956 Here in Chelsea.\n",
      "957 A woman's\n",
      "958  Chelsea.\n",

      "1092 I think you should go back with Gary. I donÂ’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Â‘YouÂ’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.Â’ and I hated that guy. And it didnÂ’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.\n",

      "1155 Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?\n",
      "1156 How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?\n",
      "1157 HeÂ’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.\n",
      "1158 Because, IÂ’m too afraid.\n",
      "1159 Yeah, thatÂ’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.\n",
      "1160 \n",
      "1161 I spelled out boobies.\n",

      "1176 IÂ’m an alien. IÂ’m an alien.\n",

      "1178 I just saw Janice.\n",
      "1179 Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kidÂ’s pretzel at them.\n",

      "1188 Hi JoeyÂ’s sisters!\n",
      "1189 Oh, IÂ’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.\n",
      "1190 No-no-no-no, no, itÂ’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why canÂ’t we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.\n",
      "1191 Well, my apartment isnÂ’t there anymore, because I drank it.\n",
      "1192 Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.\n",

      "1199 Look, when IÂ’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and IÂ’m sorry.\n",
      "1200 Why canÂ’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.\n",
      "1201 ItÂ’s gotta be the first one.\n",
      "1202 Yep, IÂ’m in a tree.\n",
      "1203 Well, thatÂ’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually IÂ’ll be in Cuba.\n",

      "1223 Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brotherÂ’s not going to punch me.  Are ya?\n",
      "1224 Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youÂ’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.\n",
      "1225 Okay, absolutely!\n",
      "1226 YouÂ’ve got it. \n",
      "1227 What?! \n",
      "1228 DonÂ’t worry.\n",

      "1235 Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.\n",
      "1236 Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.\n",
      "1237 Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud.\n",
      "1238 I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.\n",
      "1239 I'll get you the Cliff Notes.\n",
      "1240 The abridgment.\n",
      "1241 ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!\n",
      "1242 Oh no, no, no, no.\n",
      "1243 All right, I have to get that, but no-no.  So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?\n",
      "1244 Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.\n",
      "1245 To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.\n",
      "1246 Bye-bye.\n",
      "1247 What, what, what?!\n",
      "1248 You really think that is what he meant?\n",
      "1249 Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.\n",
      "1250 Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.\n",
      "1251 All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'\n",
      "1252 He paints quite a picture doesn't he?\n",
      "1253 Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she's fully dressed, right?\n",
      "1254 And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and \n",
      "1255 Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.\n",
      "1256 Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?\n",
      "1257 Man, I gotta get a kid. \n",
      "1258 Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.\n",
      "1259 Yeah, baby!\n",
      "1260 Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?\n",
      "1261 Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now sheÂ’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.\n",
      "1262 Oh, hey.\n",
      "1263  So ah, isnÂ’t a bit cold out for shorts?\n",
      "1264 Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.\n",
      "1265  IÂ’m up! IÂ’m up, IÂ’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?\n",
      "1266 Okay Ross, why donÂ’t you come with me?\n",
      "1267 RobertÂ’s coming out.\n",
      "1268 No. He.....heÂ’s coming out of his shorts.\n",
      "1269 The man is showing brain.\n",
      "1270  Wellll?\n",
      "1271 What do we do? What do we do?\n",
      "1272 Like an eclipse.\n",
      "1273 Your liking it, huh?\n",
      "1274 No, actually LaurieÂ’s a boy.\n",
      "1275 Hey.\n",
      "1276 You mean a three pointer?\n",
      "1277 IÂ’m sorry, IÂ’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isnÂ’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.\n",
      "1278 Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!\n",
      "1279 Hmmm, thatÂ’s very cool.\n",
      "1280 I canÂ’t believe she cracked your code!\n",
      "1281 No, Beth doesnÂ’t die, she doesnÂ’t die. Does she Rachel?\n",
      "1282 We canÂ’t tell him, you canÂ’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.\n",
      "1283 Yeah, we got, um-hmm.\n",
      "1284 I like her.\n",
      "1285 Well, thatÂ’s pretty much all IÂ’m looking for from these people.\n",
      "1286  All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. IÂ’d like know whether thatÂ’s several big fish or just one big fish.\n",
      "1287 No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called Â‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.Â’\n",
      "1288 Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?\n",
      "1289  This is the part where you say your name.\n",
      "1290 Ginger. IÂ’m talking to Ginger, so....\n",
      "1291 Nope, nope, IÂ’d just ah, IÂ’d rather talk to you. \n",
      "1292 Well, thatÂ’s the best kiss IÂ’ve had with anyone IÂ’ve ever met in a menÂ’s room.\n",
      "1293  Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.\n",
      "1294 Yeah, weÂ’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.\n",
      "1295 No, really youÂ’re gonna freeze.\n",
      "1296 YouÂ’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?\n",
      "1297 Hey.\n",
      "1298 Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.\n",
      "1299 Great. It was great. SheÂ’s ah, sheÂ’s great, great looking, great personality, sheÂ’s greatness.\n",
      "1300 Joey told you about the leg, huh?\n",
      "1301 Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnÂ’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I donÂ’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often itÂ’s like Â‘Hey, y'know what, whereÂ’s your leg?Â’ I mean IÂ’m the smallest person in the world arenÂ’t I? IÂ’m the smallest person in the world.\n",
      "1302  Actually heÂ’s the smallest person in the world.\n",
      "1303 It came up.\n",
      "1304 No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?\n",
      "1305 No. No. I donÂ’t think so.\n",
      "1306 ThatÂ’s-thatÂ’s my nubbin.\n",
      "1307 ItÂ’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.\n",
      "1308 Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh, what?\n",
      "1309 You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?\n",
      "1310  Well hello!\n",
      "1311 The doctor.\n",
      "1312 Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.\n",
      "1313 That was an obvious joke, and I didnÂ’t think of it. Why didnÂ’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!\n",
      "1314  Hey, does anybody need anything copied? IÂ’m going down to the Xerox place.\n",
      "1315 Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.\n",
      "1316 Yeah! You wanna come?\n",
      "1317 Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!\n",
      "1318 Uh-oh.\n",
      "1319  Okay, that hurt us.\n",
      "1320 Well ah, ........y'know.\n",
      "1321 All right, rock on. \n",
      "1322 Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?\n",
      "1323 What time is it now?\n",
      "1324 Yeah all right, so weÂ’ll hang out.\n",
      "1325 Yes. Vividly.\n",
      "1326 Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so...\n",
      "1327 Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?\n",
      "1328 She was kidding.\n",
      "1329 She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.\n",
      "1330 Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... \n",
      "1331 Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.\n",
      "1332 Well it you donÂ’t know that, then I donÂ’t want to do this with you.\n",
      "1333 And thatÂ’s the only colour that comes in.\n",
      "1334 So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.\n",
      "1335 Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.\n",
      "1336 Hey, this isnÂ’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!\n",
      "1337 Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.\n",
      "1338 Why? What happened to him?\n",
      "1339 Oh my God! Oh my God!\n",
      "1340 Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?\n",
      "1341 HeÂ’s right. NobodyÂ’s gonna benefit, and youÂ’re just gonna hurt her.\n",
      "1342 All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timingÂ’s right. And thatÂ’s what deathbeds are for.\n",
      "1343 Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. IssacÂ’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And PhoebeÂ’s friends with Rachel. And thatÂ’s the trail, I did it!\n",
      "1344 Off?!!\n",
      "1345 Yeah, well I donÂ’t think you can make that statement, unless youÂ’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.\n",
      "1346 Oh, thatÂ’s mature.\n",
      "1347 Nothing, nothing.\n",
      "1348 Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....\n",
      "1349  He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.\n",
      "1350 Uh-oh.\n",
      "1351 She was not good. Not good.\n",
      "1352 Uh-oh.\n",
      "1353 Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.\n",
      "1354 Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.\n",
      "1355  Wax the door shut, weÂ’re never leaving, ever.\n",
      "1356 Oh great, food with hair on it.\n",
      "1357 Because that would be crazy?\n",
      "1358 Yeah, come on, itÂ’s Ross and Rachel, theyÂ’ve got too.\n",
      "1359 What?\n",
      "1360 Are you actually saying these words?\n",
      "1361 LetÂ’s go.\n",
      "1362  Is that your new walk?\n",
      "1363 This is the New York Times.\n",
      "1364 We are. HeÂ’s meeting us here.\n",
      "1365 Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.\n",
      "1366 Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnÂ’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.\n",
      "1367 Y'know what maybe itÂ’s gonna be okay, I mean itÂ’s been a week.\n",
      "1368 No.\n",
      "1369 Yes, yes, itÂ’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.\n",
      "1370 Yeah, heÂ’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.\n",
      "1371  Oh my God!\n",
      "1372 Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, IÂ’m, IÂ’m smoking still.\n",
      "1373 Look, IÂ’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.\n",
      "1374 Yeahhh. IÂ’m tellinÂ’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....\n",
      "1375 Oh thatÂ’s great, with my luck, thatÂ’s gonna be him.\n",
      "1376 Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. \n",
      "1377 Hey, shut up!! YouÂ’re not my real Mom!!\n",
      "1378 Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.\n",
      "1379 Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.\n",
      "1380  Well heÂ’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.\n",
      "1381 What?\n",
      "1382 Beam me up Jesus.\n",
      "1383 Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.\n",
      "1384 Oh, come on, thereÂ’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.\n",
      "1385 Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.\n",
      "1386 Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!\n",
      "1387 \n",
      "1388 Damn!  The tailpipeÂ’s not hot enough to light this!\n",
      "1389 Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.\n",
      "1390 Ladies, ladies, letÂ’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off MonicaÂ’s bra.\n",
      "1391 Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.\n",
      "1392 Okay, now letÂ’s decide who has the nicest ass.\n",
      "1393 At least let me smoke it to the good part.\n",
      "1394 I have the lung capacity of a two year old. \n",
      "1395 Well itÂ’s very unsettling.\n",
      "1396 Oh no, now itÂ’s not gonna make any sense!\n",
      "1397 Oh, this is horrible, itÂ’s just horrible.\n",
      "1398 ItÂ’s horrible.\n",
      "1399 Y'know what, I can handle it, handleÂ’s my middle name. Actually itÂ’s the ah, middle part of my first name.\n",
      "1400 Guys, guys, guess who I am?! \n",
      "1401 I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.\n",
      "1402 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.\n",
      "1403 Okay.\n",
      "1404 No-no, why donÂ’t you hang on to that one.\n",
      "1405 Okay, thatÂ’s like the least fun game ever.\n",
      "1406 Oh. \n",
      "1407 Or what my Father called Thursday night.\n",
      "1408 Y'know, I wouldÂ’ve bet good money that heÂ’d be the first one of us to get married.\n",
      "1409 Always illegal Joe.\n",
      "1410 If that doesnÂ’t keep kids in school, what will?\n",
      "1411  Hi.\n",
      "1412 Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?\n",
      "1413 Y'know what, pretty good.\n",
      "1414 Good! I havenÂ’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.\n",
      "1415 Thanks\n",
      "1416 What check thing?\n",
      "1417  Is this him?\n",
      "1418 WhoÂ’s he hugginÂ’?\n",
      "1419 This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!\n",
      "1420 There you go!!\n",
      "1421  What?\n",
      "1422 \n",
      "1423 Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.\n",
      "1424 Okay, then get the lobster!\n",
      "1425 Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.\n",
      "1426 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?\n",
      "1427 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?\n",
      "1428 Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.\n",
      "1429 ItÂ’s possible. You are very loveable, IÂ’d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.\n",
      "1430  If I broke up with you, IÂ’d miss you.\n",
      "1431 And youÂ’re our age. YouÂ’re our age.\n",
      "1432 ThatÂ’s not a state Joe.\n",
      "1433 YouÂ’re our age!\n",
      "1434 I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnÂ’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. ItÂ’s so annoying. Does it bug you?\n",
      "1435 Is there any chance you didnÂ’t see that?\n",
      "1436 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You canÂ’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! YouÂ’re gonna get peep eye!\n",
      "1437 You didnÂ’t just break up.\n",
      "1438 You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!\n",
      "1439 Okay.\n",
      "1440 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.\n",
      "1441 Stop what?!\n",
      "1442 No!! You canÂ’t!!\n",
      "1443 I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!\n",
      "1444 Look man!\n",
      "1445 Listen to me!! \n",
      "1446 SheÂ’s moving on! Okay, if itÂ’s not this guy, itÂ’s gonna be somebody else! And unless youÂ’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? ItÂ’s over.\n",
      "1447 Okay.\n",
      "1448 I know. \n",
      "1449 I donÂ’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. \n",
      "1450  Uh-oh, what did she do now?\n",
      "1451 Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.\n",
      "1452 I think somebody has a crush on somebody.\n",
      "1453 IÂ’m talking about you. You big, big freak.\n",
      "1454 Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youÂ’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!\n",
      "1455 Â‘Cause itÂ’s-itÂ’s not his last name.\n",
      "1456 No, itÂ’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. HeÂ’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but thereÂ’s no Gold Man.\n",
      "1457 So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?\n",
      "1458 What about things that are already gold?\n",
      "1459 Okay, letÂ’s play my game now.\n",
      "1460 Wait a minute, wait. YouÂ’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnÂ’t want you back?!\n",
      "1461 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.\n",
      "1462 Hey.\n",
      "1463 Oh, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s okay, no problem. \n",
      "1464 Yes, I realise that.\n",
      "1465 ThatÂ’s the stuff! \n",
      "1466 Thanks, itÂ’s ah, Gaelic, for Â‘Thy turkeyÂ’s done.Â’ So ah, IÂ’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.\n",
      "1467 Hello.\n",
      "1468  And is this in case the house sneezes?\n",
      "1469 Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.\n",
      "1470 Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? CheckinÂ’ out the Chan-Chan man!\n",
      "1471 Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. IÂ’ll do it.\n",
      "1472  Hey, my FatherÂ’s house does that!\n",
      "1473 Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and thereÂ’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.\n",
      "1474 Of course, I didnÂ’t get to enjoy any of that, because JoannaÂ’s such a big, dull dud!\n",
      "1475  IÂ’m telling ya, JoannaÂ’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, Â‘This was fun. LetÂ’s do it again sometime. IÂ’ll give you a call.Â’\n",
      "1476 ThatÂ’s what you say at the end of a date.\n",
      "1477 To her face? Look itÂ’s the end of the date, IÂ’m standing there, I know all sheÂ’s waiting for is for me to say Â‘IÂ’ll call herÂ’ and itÂ’s just y'know, comes out. I canÂ’t help it, itÂ’s a compulsion.\n",
      "1478 Multiple, so many paper cuts.\n",
      "1479  Oh, well give me the phone then.\n",
      "1480 Look, you canÂ’t call somebody after this long just to say, Â‘In case you didnÂ’t notice, I donÂ’t like you!Â’\n",
      "1481 Nooo!! SheÂ’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!\n",
      "1482 All right! Fine! But itÂ’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I donÂ’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!\n",
      "1483 ThatÂ’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.\n",
      "1484 ItÂ’s not a big deal. ItÂ’s, just itÂ’s right here,  and itÂ’s all the time.\n",
      "1485  Yes, this, this was pleasant.\n",
      "1486 The food there was, was great.\n",
      "1487 So take care.\n",
      "1488 Well, this was great. IÂ’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. \n",
      "1489 Noo!\n",
      "1490 Look, IÂ’m sorry. Okay? IÂ’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.\n",
      "1491 AhhhhÂ—IÂ’m not going to call you.\n",
      "1492 IÂ’m sorry. IÂ’m-IÂ’m-IÂ’m sorry that I said I was going to when IÂ’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnÂ’t RachelÂ’s fault. ItÂ’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And IÂ’m really sorry, itÂ’s just that this is not, this isnÂ’t going to work out.\n",
      "1493 Yeah, o-okay.\n",
      "1494 Well this is great! IÂ’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!\n",
      "1495  Hey.\n",
      "1496 Oh, so thatÂ’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.\n",
      "1497 Hey.\n",
      "1498 No way!\n",

      "1500 Yeah. \n",
      "1501 Thanks. \n",
      "1502 So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.\n",
      "1503 Okay, so I guess thatÂ’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.\n",
      "1504 Hey!\n",
      "1505 Okay.  ItÂ’s a chicken.\n",
      "1506 Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.\n",

      "1510 She?\n",
      "1511 I donÂ’t know.  I canÂ’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.\n",
      "1512 Excuse me?\n",
      "1513 I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!\n",
      "1514 You donÂ’t think I get up when you get up?\n",
      "1515 Yes, here it comes! IÂ’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I donÂ’t think so mister!\n",
      "1516 And you donÂ’t think taking care of our chick is work?\n",
      "1517 I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, weÂ’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?\n",
      "1518 IÂ’ll take her back tomorrow.\n",
      "1519 Hey!\n",
      "1520  Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!\n",
      "1521 I know. See, yes. ThatÂ’s Yasmine Bleeth, sheÂ’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.\n",
      "1522 Hey!\n",
      "1523 I did! But the store wouldnÂ’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?\n",
      "1524 If they canÂ’t find a home for her, they kill her! And IÂ’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!\n",
      "1525 Okay. And itÂ’s not just chicks y'know? ItÂ’s all kinds of other animals!\n",
      "1526 Thanks, IÂ’m glad you see it that way.\n",
      "1527 Ohhh-hoo, funny story!\n",
      "1528 Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!\n",
      "1529 ThatÂ’s a bad duck!!!  HowÂ’d the thing go tonight, Ross?\n",
      "1530 \n",
      "1531  What did you do?\n",
      "1532 Having a swim.\n",
      "1533 Chicks donÂ’t swim.\n",
      "1534 I donÂ’t know. Should we try it?\n",
      "1535 See, I told you they donÂ’t swim. \n",
      "1536 Noo!  Oh, itÂ’s okay, itÂ’s okay, baby, baby, baby.\n",
      "1537 Ye-e-es!!\n",
      "1538 WhoÂ’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.\n",
      "1539 Bye!\n",
      "1540 Yeah, and I donÂ’t have any cologne.\n",
      "1541 Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.\n",
      "1542  Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?\n",
      "1543 Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.\n",
      "1544  There he is!\n",
      "1545 Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.\n",
      "1546 I know.\n",
      "1547 So thatÂ’s the girl you like.\n",
      "1548 Wait a minute, wait a minute, you donÂ’t like the guy RachelÂ’s dating? Well, thatÂ’s odd.\n",
      "1549 Could I borrow it?\n",
      "1550 Oh-ho-ho-ho.\n",
      "1551 7:15.  Watch doesnÂ’t work.\n",
      "1552 Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together!\n",
      "1553 Ross, donÂ’t. Ross!\n",
      "1554 Ohh, thatÂ’s a good one.\n",
      "1555 Why donÂ’t you use ours across the hall, Â‘cause sheÂ…",
      "hasÂ…",
      "problems.\n",
      "1556 Step away from the duck.\n",
      "1557 And yet, sheÂ’s still not hanging up the phone.\n",
      "1558 Or... Dick.\n",
      "1559 Was it like a sneeze only better?\n",
      "1560 No!!\n",
      "1561 Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh.\n",

      "1564 Hey!\n",
      "1565 Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.\n",
      "1566 You're right, I know.\n",
      "1567  Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?\n",
      "1568 Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.\n",
      "1569 Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.\n",
      "1570 Well sensitive is important, pick him.\n",
      "1571  I-kea! This is comfortable.\n",
      "1572 So, what do you thing the good news is?\n",
      "1573 Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? HeÂ’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thatÂ’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.\n",
      "1574 Oh, so youÂ’re going with the teacher, huh?\n",
      "1575  EverythingÂ’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?\n",
      "1576 Do you think that thereÂ’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as youÂ’re driving into town thereÂ’s-thereÂ’s like a sign, and it says Â“YouÂ’re in Sample.Â” \n",
      "1577 Yeah, itÂ’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Â“TheyÂ’re are no rules.Â”\n",
      "1578 Yes, but thereÂ’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.\n",
      "1579 Oh itÂ’s Bing, sir. IÂ’m sorry , I was just ah...\n",
      "1580 All right buddy, way to go! \n",
      "1581 Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.\n",
      "1582 Well, I didnÂ’t do anything. I didnÂ’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.\n",
      "1583 Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between Â‘em.\n",
      "1584  What if Joey were president?\n",
      "1585  What is with him?\n",
      "1586 Well, thatÂ’s not true, he-he smacked you once.\n",
      "1587 No sir.\n",
      "1588  Hey! Which oneÂ’s my turkey burger?\n",
      "1589 Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, itÂ’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow IÂ’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.\n",
      "1590 Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!\n",
      "1591 No, I ah, I didnÂ’t do them.\n",
      "1592 No, no I just ah, didnÂ’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly donÂ’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.\n",
      "1593 Doug!!\n",
      "1594 IÂ’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.\n",
      "1595 No, no. It-itÂ’s not about the swearing, itÂ’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.\n",
      "1596 Oh, and donÂ’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. ItÂ’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, itÂ’s making all the other guys jealous.\n",
      "1597 Okay. \n",
      "1598 Ahhhhh! \n",
      "1599 Thank you, sir.\n",
      "1600 No. No, not at all, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s ridiculous.\n",
      "1601 Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!\n",
      "1602 Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!\n",
      "1603  So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!\n",
      "1604 Tell it again.  Seriously.\n",
      "1605  Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.\n",
      "1606 YouÂ’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.\n",
      "1607 Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, IÂ’ll be your boyfriend.\n",
      "1608 Why is that so funny?\n",
      "1609 Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?\n",
      "1610 Okay, so weÂ’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werenÂ’t friends, say itÂ’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and IÂ’m like  Â“Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.Â”\n",
      "1611 Hey!\n",
      "1612 What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I canÂ’t have children!!\n",
      "1613 Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?\n",
      "1614 Big bullies!!\n",
      "1615 Hey!\n",
      "1616 Bored and bored!\n",
      "1617 Yes!\n",
      "1618 Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.\n",
      "1619 So, you still donÂ’t think IÂ’m boyfriend material?\n",
      "1620 I saw you checking me out during the game last night.\n",
      "1621 Yeah, well, lucky for you.\n",
      "1622 I donÂ’t know.\n",
      "1623 Oh, yeah, I donÂ’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.\n",
      "1624 Where ya going?\n",
      "1625  Noo!! I donÂ’t care! IÂ’m not, IÂ’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!\n",
      "1626 Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You donÂ’t need that kindÂ’ve hurt. Take it from a guy whoÂ’s never had a long term relationship......\n",
      "1627 Ahhhh! \n",
      "1628 Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.\n",
      "1629 There is not one hair on that head.\n",
      "1630  Hi there.\n",
      "1631 Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youÂ’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!\n",
      "1632 Hi! IÂ’m Dorf! YouÂ’re date for the evening.  Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thatÂ’s good stuff!!\n",
      "1633 \n",
      "1634  Oh, IÂ’ll go out and get you some.\n",
      "1635 Nope! Because IÂ’m not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?\n",
      "1636 I found a dried up seashores.\n",
      "1637 All right, thereÂ’s a nuclear holocaust, IÂ’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?\n",
      "1638 IÂ’ve got canned goods.\n",
      "1639 Excellent hole, Joe.\n",
      "1640 Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!\n",
      "1641 WeÂ’ve got to do something!\n",
      "1642 Y'know what, heÂ’s right. ThereÂ’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.\n",
      "1643 Me too!!\n",
      "1644 Oh my God! If you say that one more time, IÂ’m gonna break up with you!\n",
      "1645 Look, Ross, you have what you want, youÂ’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youÂ’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.\n",
      "1646  Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!\n",
      "1647 IÂ’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.\n",
      "1648  TheyÂ’ll never understand!\n",
      "1649 \n",
      "1650 And then Joey remembered something.\n",
      "1651  Joey kept screaming at me, Â“Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!Â” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.\n",
      "1652  Coffee house?\n",
      "1653 I KNEW IT!!!!\n",
      "1654 We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.\n",
      "1655 Okay. All right.\n",
      "1656 Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!\n",
      "1657 You donÂ’t turn and slide, you throw it out! IÂ’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!\n",
      "1658 All right, how about we, how Â‘bout we sell it.\n",
      "1659  They seem all right with it!\n",
      "1660 Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.\n",
      "1661 \n",
      "1662 You want it?\n",
      "1663 Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?\n",
      "1664 All right look, IÂ’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.\n",
      "1665  Nooo.\n",
      "1666 I canÂ’t believe you donÂ’t know what I do for a living!\n",
      "1667  Let it go!!\n",
      "1668 Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.\n",
      "1669 YouÂ’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.\n",
      "1670 Y'know, I, I really donÂ’t think we need a canoe.\n",
      "1671 All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!\n",
      "1672 Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times heÂ’s wrong.\n",
      "1673 Oh-no, heÂ’s right.\n",
      "1674 IÂ’m coming already!!\n",
      "1675 OH MY GOD!!!\n",
      "1676 Are you all right?!\n",
      "1677  What happened?!!\n",
      "1678 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!\n",
      "1679 SoÂ—You got in voluntarily?!\n",
      "1680 BEND OVER?!!!\n",
      "1681 Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!\n",
      "1682 Oh, they said uh, Â“You donÂ’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.Â”\n",
      "1683 Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, weÂ’d really appreciate it. \n",
      "1684 Oh no-no-no, IÂ’m, IÂ’m paddling away!\n",
      "1685 Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!\n",
      "1686 Could we be more white trash?\n",
      "1687 Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.\n",
      "1688 Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.\n",
      "1689  No. No!\n",
      "1690 Well, not at first.\n",
      "1691 Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.\n",
      "1692 Oh, come on! ItÂ’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually IÂ’m pretty much just in there by myself.\n",
      "1693 Okay, I promise, IÂ’ll end it.\n",
      "1694 I hope you know what IÂ’m giving up for ya, because sheÂ’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.\n",
      "1695 it was like the Algonquin kids table. \n",
      "1696 It just doesnÂ’tÂ…",
      "feel like weÂ’re breaking up.\n",
      "1697 Okay.\n",
      "1698 Thanks.\n",
      "1699 Okay. \n",
      "1700 IÂ’m getting dressed.\n",
      "1701 When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.\n",
      "1702 What is it?\n",
      "1703 Ah-ha, youÂ’re not the boss of me.  Ooh, saucy.\n",
      "1704 You are, youÂ’re gonna leave me like this?\n",
      "1705 Okay. But if you donÂ’t come back soon,  thereÂ’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!\n",
      "1706 Hi!  How are you?\n",
      "1707 Hello, JoannaÂ…",
      "Â…",
      "Â’s office.\n",
      "1708 How little?!\n",
      "1709 Look, this isnÂ’t funny! You get back here right now!\n",
      "1710 Why not?!\n",
      "1711 What?!\n",
      "1712  Rachel, could I see you for a moment?\n",
      "1713 Okay, hereÂ’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.\n",
      "1714 I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!\n",
      "1715 It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.\n",
      "1716 No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I canÂ’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and IÂ’m cold, and \n",
      "1717 Never!\n",
      "1718 Fine!\n",
      "1719 IÂ—never borrowed your Walkman.\n",
      "1720 You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! \n",
      "1721 No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!\n",
      "1722 About what?\n",
      "1723 IÂ’ll make something up! IÂ’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!\n",
      "1724 Oh-ho-ho, I donÂ’t think so!\n",
      "1725 Well, this is much better.\n",
      "1726 Hey, look, youÂ’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, sheÂ’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.\n",
      "1727 It still wouldnÂ’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.\n",
      "1728 Freedom!\n",
      "1729 Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wonÂ’t you here me?! \n",
      "1730 IÂ’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please justÂ…",
      " \n",
      "1731 No!\n",
      "1732 With extra pulp?\n",
      "1733 No!\n",
      "1734 You donÂ’t have it.\n",
      "1735 How do Monica and Phoebe know?\n",
      "1736  Go on.\n",
      "1737 And Milton Berle has a\n",
      "1738  Hello.\n",
      "1739 \n",
      "1740  Two hours, that lasted!\n",
      "1741 I think so.\n",
      "1742 Could there be more Kims?\n",
      "1743 Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnÂ’t say Â‘coolÂ’ anymore.\n",
      "1744 Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but IÂ’ve missed the last 1200 times.\n",
      "1745 You donÂ’t think IÂ’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.\n",
      "1746 Oh Maria. You canÂ’t say no to her, sheÂ’s like this lycra spandex covered gymÂ…",
      "treat.\n",
      "1747 No!\n",
      "1748 Oh no, youÂ’ll have to come.\n",
      "1749 Why donÂ’t you just give him to somebody else?\n",
      "1750 Because thatÂ’s the only part of you he can see when heÂ’s on the table!\n",
      "1751 Yes.  Yes!\n",
      "1752 No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!\n",
      "1753 Okay.  I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "1754 I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "1755  I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "1756  I wanna quit the gym.\n",
      "1757 Hey.\n",
      "1758 No, I almost did, couldnÂ’t leave Ross there without a spotter!\n",
      "1759 WeÂ’re doomed. Okay, theyÂ’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?\n",
      "1760 YouÂ’re a genius!\n",
      "1761 Now, thereÂ’s two reasons.\n",
      "1762 Thank you, Joey.\n",
      "1763 Hi.\n",
      "1764 No, weÂ’d just like to close them.\n",
      "1765 I wanna quit the bank!\n",
      "1766 To pay for the gym.\n",
      "1767 Hey.\n",
      "1768 YeahÂ…",
      " Bunny-rabbit.\n",
      "1769 Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.\n",
      "1770 I could die.\n",
      "1771 I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.\n",
      "1772 Hey! \n",
      "1773 All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?\n",
      "1774  Wish me luck.\n",
      "1775 Wish it!  Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?\n",
      "1776 Uh Kathy, with K or a C?\n",
      "1777 Oh-oh-hey!\n",
      "1778 Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.\n",
      "1779 Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. \n",
      "1780 Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.\n",
      "1781  Hi!\n",
      "1782 Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.\n",
      "1783 Oh my God! That's why I got up too!\n",
      "1784 Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...\n",
      "1785 So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.\n",
      "1786 That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.\n",
      "1787 Is it on?\n",
      "1788 Hey! \n",
      "1789 Oh! It's on! It's on!\n",
      "1790 There we go little fella.\n",
      "1791 Well the duck can swim.\n",
      "1792 Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.\n",
      "1793 She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?\n",
      "1794 No, I don't.\n",
      "1795 Thank you, Ross.\n",
      "1796 All right.\n",
      "1797 All right.\n",
      "1798 Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy.\n",
      "1799 Oh, I just wanted to say, \"Hey!\"\n",
      "1800 Okay. \n",
      "1801  Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.\n",
      "1802 I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!\n",
      "1803 Really?!\n",
      "1804  Right in there!\n",
      "1805 99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time.\n",
      "1806 Hey!\n",
      "1807 Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.\n",
      "1808 Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.\n",
      "1809 You-you do?\n",
      "1810 You got me.\n",
      "1811 Yeah. Right.\n",
      "1812 Okay.\n",
      "1813 Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.\n",
      "1814 Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.\n",
      "1815 Uhh, no-no thanks.\n",
      "1816 Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. \n",
      "1817 What?\n",
      "1818 Hey, look, what do you want from me?\n",
      "1819 I am pretending.\n",
      "1820 Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!\n",
      "1821 Can I sleep on your couch?\n",
      "1822 Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.\n",
      "1823 Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?\n",
      "1824 Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.\n",
      "1825 Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?\n",
      "1826 Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.\n",
      "1827 Well, I have a call in about that.\n",
      "1828 Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.\n",
      "1829 Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.\n",
      "1830 Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.\n",
      "1831 It doesn't say that. Does it?\n",
      "1832 Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.\n",
      "1833 It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?\n",
      "1834  Sure...\n",
      "1835 I don't know... um, Grease?\n",
      "1836 Rent?\n",
      "1837 Okay, so when do you want to go?\n",
      "1838 Yes, it is, at Office Max.\n",
      "1839 A pen.\n",
      "1840 Huh-huh! You can't give her that.\n",
      "1841 Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!\n",
      "1842 All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?\n",
      "1843 For three years?\n",
      "1844 All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?\n",
      "1845 Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?\n",
      "1846 Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.\n",
      "1847 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called \"Invisible things for Kathy.\"  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?\n",
      "1848 She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.\n",
      "1849 Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?\n",
      "1850 Where?\n",
      "1851 I got something for her.  It's a book!\n",
      "1852 No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?\n",
      "1853 No, it came out to an even twenty.\n",
      "1854 Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?\n",
      "1855 Oh yeah? That's great!\n",
      "1856 [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh.... [Kathy enters]\n",
      "1857 Hey! Happy birthday.\n",
      "1858 No he didn't. [Moving it back.\n",
      "1859 Happy birthday! I'm sorry.\n",
      "1860 See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.\n",
      "1861 Oh, yeah... yeah.\n",
      "1862 [to Kathy] Goodnight.\n",
      "1863 Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.\n",
      "1864 Uh, the book?\n",
      "1865 What do you mean?\n",
      "1866  Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, \"Uhl, ell.\"\n",
      "1867 Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.\n",
      "1868 Goodnight. \n",
      "1869  I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!\n",
      "1870 It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean itÂ’s bad enough that IÂ’m in love with my roommates girlfriendÂ—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time weÂ’re in the room together thereÂ’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when IÂ’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, sheÂ’s smooth! Smooth! \n",
      "1871  Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?\n",
      "1872 GoinÂ’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnÂ’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.\n",
      "1873  What?\n",
      "1874 Wait! YouÂ’re going out with Kathy!\n",
      "1875 Well, IÂ’m upsetÂ—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. \n",
      "1876 Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that sheÂ’s-sheÂ’s smart, and funny, and gets you.\n",
      "1877 All right look, I think itÂ’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.\n",
      "1878 All right! Bring it on, you\n",
      "1879  Oh my God! Play!\n",
      "1880 Really, bitchinÂ’!\n",
      "1881 You mean like, music?\n",
      "1882 Yeah, I know what youÂ’re thinkinÂ’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.\n",
      "1883 Come in!\n",
      "1884 Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.\n",
      "1885 No-no, heÂ’s not back yet, but heÂ’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?\n",
      "1886 I like it in the stern.  Hello.\n",
      "1887 What happened?\n",
      "1888 Why canÂ’t you tell her?\n",
      "1889 Joey! Joey!!\n",
      "1890 I thought your time ran out.\n",
      "1891  Uhh, that was Joey. HeÂ’s running a little late, he says heÂ’s sorry.\n",
      "1892 So I guess itÂ’s just uh, you and me then.\n",
      "1893 Yeah, I think it is!\n",
      "1894 Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut\n",
      "1895 and then it got canceled.\n",
      "1896 Really?! You do that?\n",
      "1897 Dog grooming huh? Okay, just donÂ’t make my tail too poofy.\n",
      "1898 Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  YÂ’know who also has great hair is Joey!\n",
      "1899 What-what Â‘cha doinÂ’?\n",
      "1900 Â‘Kay.\n",
      "1901  Hello!\n",

      "1907 Oh.\n",
      "1908 No-no-no-no, this is bad! ItÂ’s bad! This is bad!\n",
      "1909 Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?\n",
      "1910 Okay!\n",
      "1911 Ooh! Yes! Okay! HereÂ’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.\n",
      "1912 Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means weÂ’re unhappy forever. Sound good?\n",
      "1913 I have to; heÂ’s my best friend, and youÂ’re seeing him.\n",
      "1914  Oh-no-no-no! DonÂ’t! DonÂ’t! See-see, youÂ’re getting me confused, IÂ’m starting to urn.\n",
      "1915 I-I think we have too.\n",
      "1916 Bye.  Are you still out there?\n",
      "1917 Hang on buddy! \n",
      "1918 I sure did.\n",

      "2031 Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?\n",
      "2032 Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whoÂ’s boss.\n",
      "2033  Yes.\n",

      "2080 Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.\n",
      "2081 All right, we havenÂ’t had sex yet. Okay, whatÂ’s the big deal? YÂ’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.\n",
      "2082 No, heÂ’s right, IÂ’m totally lying.\n",
      "2083 Well, KathyÂ’s last boyfriend was Joey.\n",
      "2084 No, IÂ’m afraid I wonÂ’t be able to make love as well as him.\n",
      "2085 Yes, and I was saying the actual words.\n",
      "2086 We share a wall! So either heÂ’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.\n",
      "2087 Yeah?\n",
      "2088 All right, all right, IÂ’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But IÂ’m just doing it for you guys.\n",

      "2091 Yes, yes, we had the sex.\n",
      "2092 It was fine, yÂ’know? But she didnÂ’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, \"I see you point, IÂ’m all right with it.\"\n",
      "2093 Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yÂ’know, I know where everything goes, itÂ’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, \"My God! SomebodyÂ’s killing her in there!\"\n",
      "2094 Look, you donÂ’t have to draw an actual woÂ—whoa! SheÂ’s hot!\n",
      "2095  There are seven?!\n",

      "2138 Well believe it baby!\n",
      "2139 I knew it!\n",
      "2140 Cool, girl roommate.\n",
      "2141 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!\n",
      "2142 What?! What-what is it?!\n",
      "2143 I canÂ’t believe we live here!\n",
      "2144 Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!\n",
      "2145 I know!!\n",
      "2146 Wow! She looks great. DoesnÂ’t she?\n",
      "2147 Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!\n",
      "2148 Yeah, itÂ’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!\n",
      "2149 IÂ’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyÂ’re gonna go to their cast parties and heÂ’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itÂ’ll be like, \"So whereÂ’s your boyfriend, whatÂ’s-his-name, Chester?\" And sheÂ’ll go, \"No-no-no, itÂ’s Chandler.\" And heÂ’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"\n",
      "2150 All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?\n",
      "2151 Really?\n",
      "2152 So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?\n",
      "2153 Yeah, I know but\n",
      "2154 Okay, okay, but donÂ’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which IÂ’m fairly certain are the same thing.\n",
      "2155 IÂ’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now thereÂ’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!\n",
      "2156 Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!\n",
      "2157 Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youÂ’re having sex with him.\n",
      "2158 Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!\n",
      "2159 YÂ’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youÂ’re up there every night, youÂ’re naked, touching, kissing.\n",
      "2160 Well, you can understand, given how we started.\n",
      "2161 Well, that is what happened, and I donÂ’t even see you denying this!\n",
      "2162 Yeah, well, donÂ’t expect that to happen anytime soon!\n",
      "2163 Steps!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!\n",
      "2164 I confronted her, and she didnÂ’t deny it! \n",
      "2165 Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak JulieÂ’s\n",
      "2166 Yes! See you and I have always been likeÂ—\n",
      "2167 Did she call?\n",
      "2168 All right, maybe I should call her.\n",
      "2169 Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?\n",
      "2170 Well y'know, what if she didnÂ’t actually sleep with the guy?\n",
      "2171 She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!\n",
      "2172 ThatÂ’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.\n",
      "2173 Oh my God!!\n",
      "2174 Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that IÂ’m sorry. YÂ’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.\n",
      "2175 Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yÂ’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? Â‘Cause weÂ’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. YÂ’know, I know for meÂ— NickÂ’s pants?\n",
      "2176 Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!\n",
      "2177 Well, she wasnÂ’t sleeping with him.\n",
      "2178 She is now.\n",
      "2179 IÂ’m saying that sheÂ…",
      " is a devil woman! YÂ’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I donÂ’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.\n",
      "2180 Because, I-I shouldÂ’ve called! YÂ’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldÂ’ve gone out with Nick, and they wouldÂ’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!\n",
      "2181 You donÂ’t have to stop having fun just because IÂ’m here. Kathy didnÂ’t cheat on all of you. \n",
      "2182  Would you give me one minute!! Please.\n",
      "2183 YÂ’know, I canÂ’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on IÂ’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!\n",
      "2184 ThatÂ’s right! Where are the guys? IÂ’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.\n",
      "2185 They got a breakfast buffet.\n",
      "2186 Ooh, let me talk to him!\n",
      "2187 Well, can I just\n",
      "2188 SheÂ’s shhing me! ItÂ’s my phone and sheÂ’s shhing me!\n",
      "2189 Ow!\n",
      "2190 Maybe, she doesnÂ’t hit him all the time.\n",
      "2191 Okay, IÂ’m going to go stand over there. \n",
      "2192 So yÂ’know, uh, whenÂ’s he getting back?\n",
      "2193 YÂ’know, I knew something like this was going to happen. \n",
      "2194 Yes you can. YouÂ’re thinking about time, you canÂ’t go back in time.\n",
      "2195  No you canÂ’t.\n",
      "2196 You donÂ’t want to be guys, youÂ’d be all hairy and wouldnÂ’t live as long. \n",
      "2197 Okay. \n",
      "2198 No thanks, Mom!\n",
      "2199 Ahh, come on! YÂ’know whatÂ—yÂ’know what, I think IÂ’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.\n",
      "2200 No! That was a test! In a couple of hours IÂ’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, IÂ’m gonna get so drunk, IÂ’m gonna wanna call Janice\n",
      "2201 Ohhh!!\n",
      "2202 Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!\n",
      "2203 All right, well IÂ’m gonna put my sweats back on.\n",
      "2204 Yeah?\n",
      "2205 Stripping!\n",
      "2206 Okay, look, IÂ’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.\n",
      "2207 Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnÂ’t picture myself with any of them. \n",
      "2208  Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!\n",
      "2209 I am totally picturing you with all those women!\n",
      "2210 Well, IÂ’m there too!\n",
      "2211 Stop it! YouÂ’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!\n",
      "2212 Where I donÂ’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!\n",
      "2213 Come on, let me see that smile.\n",
      "2214 Please?\n",
      "2215 I know, I know, but youÂ’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.\n",
      "2216 All right ladies, hereÂ’s what weÂ’re gonna do.  And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, \"ChandlerÂ’s the king! ChandlerÂ’s the king!\"\n",
      "2217 Oh, thatÂ’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.\n",
      "2218 Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!\n",
      "2219 What do you want from me, IÂ’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, IÂ’m sorry you canÂ’t stay,  All right, listen, IÂ’ve got to wake up!\n",
      "2220 Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun!  Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!\n",
      "2221 ThatÂ’s a mailman! ThatÂ’s our mailman!  Hi. How are ya?\n",
      "2222 Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?\n",
      "2223  Hello!\n",
      "2224 IsnÂ’t this amazing?\n",
      "2225 Okay. Bye.\n",
      "2226 Bye.\n",
      "2227 Bye.\n",
      "2228 B-bye!\n",
      "2229 Bye. \n",
      "2230 Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityÂ—Well, theyÂ’re all back! YÂ’know? And sheÂ’s picked up like nine new ones!\n",
      "2231 DonÂ’t worry about it. IÂ’m taking care of it tonight. \n",
      "2232 \n",
      "2233 Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.\n",
      "2234  Okay, we have to talk. IÂ’m just getting out of a very serious relationship\n",
      "2235 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.\n",
      "2236 I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!\n",
      "2237 No! No! Not, Paris.\n",
      "2238 Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. ThatÂ’s right, yes, IÂ’m being transferred to Yemen!\n",
      "2239 I donÂ’t know exactly.\n",
      "2240 But I do know that itÂ’s some time tomorrow.\n",
      "2241 YÂ’know uh, you didnÂ’t really have to help me pack.\n",
      "2242 Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!\n",
      "2243 Oh, IÂ’m packing. YÂ’know IÂ’m-IÂ’m packing Â‘cause IÂ’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.\n",
      "2244 IÂ’m only going to pretend IÂ’m moving to Yemen, itÂ’s the only way I can get rid off her.\n",
      "2245  Joey, trade lives with me!\n",
      "2246  Thanks!\n",
      "2247 YÂ’know you, really didnÂ’t have to take me to the airport.\n",
      "2248 Well, weÂ’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.\n",
      "2249 Okay. Then I guess itÂ’s just, wait here then.  Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.\n",
      "2250 Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.\n",
      "2251 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?\n",
      "2252 No. All right, yÂ’know what, sheÂ’s  gonna think that IÂ’m handing you a credit card, but what IÂ’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.\n",
      "2253  American Express?\n",
      "2254 Well, I-I guess I gotta go.\n",
      "2255 Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.\n",
      "2256 Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.\n",
      "2257 No!\n",
      "2258 Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!\n",
      "2259 Well, I then guess IÂ’m going to Yemen! IÂ’m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?\n",
      "2260 Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.\n",
      "2261 What are you writing?\n",
      "2262 Oh yeah?  never go out of styleÂ—what did you throw away?\n",
      "2263 Hi guys!\n",
      "2264 Without me?!\n",
      "2265 Yes, but in RossÂ’s case, they both know in two weeks thatÂ’s it.\n",
      "2266 Maybe thatÂ’s because soy-burgers suck!\n",
      "2267 What are you talking about?\n",
      "2268 Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? \n",
      "2269 Like what?\n",
      "2270 I said, \"Like what?\"\n",
      "2271 Does for me.\n",
      "2272 Flashdance.\n",
      "2273 She was a welder.\n",
      "2274 What are the odds? What are the odds?\n",
      "2275 Okay.\n",
      "2276 ThereÂ’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! \n",
      "2277 Hey.\n",
      "2278 Oh-ho, yeah!\n",
      "2279 TreegerÂ’s snaking the shower drain.\n",
      "2280 Hey!\n",
      "2281 Do we pay for this?\n",
      "2282 Maybe we shouldnÂ’t pay our phone billÂ—free phone sex.\n",
      "2283 Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!\n",
      "2284 Like finding money with naked people on it!\n",
      "2285 We donÂ’t know what could make this go away.\n",
      "2286 And no one touches the air around the TV!\n",
      "2287 We still have porn.\n",
      "2288 Or a job where you donÂ’t have to carry a table.\n",
      "2289 ItÂ’s the theme from Good Will Humping.\n",
      "2290 Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?\n",
      "2291 They donÂ’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.\n",
      "2292 Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?\n",
      "2293 All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, itÂ’s over.\n",
      "2294 What?\n",
      "2295 Okay.  Good one.\n",
      "2296 Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.\n",
      "2297 Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.\n",
      "2298 Pregnant Woman Slays Four?\n",
      "2299 WhatÂ’s the second part of your plan?\n",
      "2300 You put your fist through the wall?\n",

      "2302 Are we in London?\n",
      "2303 Hey.\n",
      "2304 I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnÂ’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.\n",
      "2305 What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"\n",
      "2306 YÂ’know what, we have to turn off the porn.\n",
      "2307 All right, ready?\n",
      "2308 Two.\n",

      "2317 Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.\n",
      "2318 Hey, yÂ’know what, if youÂ’re gonna do that, if youÂ’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! ChandlerÂ’s funny, sophisticated, and heÂ’s very loveable, once you get to know him.\n",
      "2319 Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, heÂ’ll be there. And heÂ’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youÂ’re really hot.\n",
      "2320 Hey!\n",
      "2321 And now youÂ’re giving me the message!\n",
      "2322 You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?\n",
      "2323 Hi! Hi! YouÂ’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.\n",
      "2324 Raymond Chandler.\n",
      "2325 Okay, there are no famous JoeyÂ’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.\n",
      "2326 Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, heÂ’ll never be President. ThereÂ’s never gonna be a President Joey.\n",
      "2327 Wow, youÂ’re, youÂ’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.\n",
      "2328 Okay.\n",
      "2329 No, no, youÂ’re right, it is a ridiculous name!\n",
      "2330 Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.\n",
      "2331 I have no name.\n",
      "2332 Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.\n",
      "2333 Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?\n",
      "2334 ItÂ’s Clint. ItÂ’s Clint! \n",
      "2335 ItÂ’s Clint! Clint!\n",
      "2336  Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?\n",
      "2337 All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.\n",
      "2338 Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, itÂ’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with womenÂ…",
      " So, as of 4 oÂ’clock tomorrow, IÂ’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.\n",
      "2339  Really?!\n",
      "2340 Okay. Thanks.\n",

      "2349 Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I donÂ’t belong here.\"\n",
      "2350 Yeah we do!\n",
      "2351 Are you serious?\n",
      "2352 Forget it! Okay, IÂ’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!\n",
      "2353 No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.\n",
      "2354  Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?\n",
      "2355 Forget it! Okay, IÂ’m not giving up the apartment.\n",
      "2356 Oh my God!\n",

      "2358 Where is Emily?\n",
      "2359 Man, didnÂ’t she like just get here?\n",
      "2360 Easy tiger.\n",
      "2361 So what are you going to do?\n",
      "2362 Are you serious?\n",
      "2363 Because youÂ’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, IÂ’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge IÂ’ve had a longer relationship with!\n",
      "2364 And I love the milk! But, IÂ’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.\n",
      "2365 Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.\n",
      "2366 No thank you.\n",
      "2367 Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we canÂ’t leave in the small apartment after weÂ’ve lived here! DidnÂ’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?\n",
      "2368 Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.\n",
      "2369 Screw the Knicks!\n",
      "2370 I didnÂ’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.\n",
      "2371 And the Knicks rule all.\n",
      "2372 No. No. WeÂ’re not gonna do that, yÂ’know why? Because its not an even trade.\n",
      "2373 No!\n",
      "2374 Op, op, IÂ’m convinced!\n",
      "2375 All right, but you canÂ’t use that again for a whole year. IÂ’m in.\n",
      "2376 Okay!\n",
      "2377 Fine, letÂ’s do it.\n",
      "2378 Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first\n",

      "2382 Tickets please!  ThatÂ’s courtside baby!\n",
      "2383 No they didnÂ’t!\n",
      "2384 Those were like the best seats ever.\n",
      "2385 Oh yeah, thatÂ’s very nice. Plus, yÂ’know they were free and theyÂ’re too small.\n",
      "2386 Oh. Oh, God! \n",
      "2387 I KNOW!!!\n",
      "2388 Open up! Open up! Open up!\n",
      "2389 What the hell is going on?!\n",
      "2390 We are switching back, right now!\n",
      "2391 Well, youÂ’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, weÂ’re switching it back! ThereÂ’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?\n",
      "2392 What?\n",
      "2393 I donÂ’t care, this is our apartment! And they stoleÂ—you stole itÂ—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. IÂ’m getting back right now!\n",
      "2394 Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You canÂ’t offer anything to us!\n",
      "2395 Totally worth it!\n",

      "2400 Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?\n",
      "2401 Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please?  So uh, what do you do when youÂ’re not working here?\n",
      "2402 Oh, okay, thanks. \n",
      "2403 Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because IÂ’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!\n",
      "2404 ItÂ’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!\n",
      "2405 They donÂ’t have those.\n",
      "2406 Next time you snore, IÂ’m rolling ya over!\n",
      "2407 Hey, all right!\n",

      "2412 ItÂ’s 6:00.\n",
      "2413 Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thatÂ’s, I think thatÂ’s really cool.\n",
      "2414 What?\n",
      "2415 Yeah, well, I donÂ’t dance at weddings.\n",
      "2416 Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like thisÂ…",
      " \n",
      "2417 Hey!\n",
      "2418 Nothing.\n",

      "2426  Hello! Little ones.\n",
      "2427 Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.  Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.\n",
      "2428 Because IÂ’m cooler.\n",
      "2429 Well sheÂ’s, sheÂ’s the kinda girlÂ—Joey was unconscious.\n",
      "2430 Plus, you look cool.\n",
      "2431 YÂ’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.\n",
      "2432 Phoebe is, making people.\n",
      "2433 And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!\n",
      "2434 No-no, not something stupid, something huge.\n",
      "2435 Why not?! I mean itÂ’s just, itÂ’s just climbing! ItÂ’s just, itÂ’s just steep!\n",
      "2436 WeÂ’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!\n",
      "2437 Yeah baby!\n",
      "2438  Yeah, well\n",
      "2439 Yeah, we could do that without yÂ’know risking our lives at all!\n",
      "2440  Oh, well\n",
      "2441 Yeeeeahhhh.\n",
      "2442 But IÂ’ll tell you something. One of these days weÂ’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!\n",

      "2448  Noo.\n",
      "2449 I didnÂ’t know that.\n",
      "2450 See, maybe thatÂ’s the one we shouldÂ’ve actually hidden.\n",
      "2451 This isnÂ’t one of those uh, yÂ’know \"If she doesnÂ’t come, we-we donÂ’t, we donÂ’t come?\" Right? Because I already bought my ticket\n",
      "2452 Oh, that's Ross's.\n",
      "2453 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?\n",

      "2458 Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.\n",
      "2459 If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.\n",

      "2480 So you might say, itÂ’s a magic ring.\n",
      "2481 Well, I think it all started when you said, \"Hey Joey, why donÂ’t you be my best man.\"\n",
      "2482 Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?\n",
      "2483 \n",

      "2604 Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?\n",
      "2605 All right\n",
      "2606 Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.\n",
      "2607 Really? Male nurses?\n",
      "2608 So they're going on dates? When?\n",
      "2609 This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?\n",
      "2610 All right.\n",
      "2611  Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!\n",
      "2612 Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.\n",
      "2613 Fine! Maybe I will too!\n",
      "2614 So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?\n",
      "2615 Oh.\n",
      "2616 Sure. \n",
      "2617  Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?\n",
      "2618 All right. Very good.\n",
      "2619 Bye, momi-moo.\n",
      "2620 Yes!\n",
      "2621 Oh God, kindergarten flashback.\n",
      "2622 Okay, keep saying it!\n",
      "2623 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?\n",
      "2624 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionaryÂ…",
      " Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.\n",
      "2625 Really? Okay, so\n",
      "2626 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?\n",
      "2627 Right!\n",
      "2628 So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?\n",
      "2629 That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?\n",
      "2630 -enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!\n",
      "2631 Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!\n",
      "2632 Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.\n",
      "2633 Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.\n",
      "2634 Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.\n",
      "2635 Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?\n",
      "2636 Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!\n",
      "2637 Yes!\n",
      "2638  Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?\n",
      "2639 If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?\n",
      "2640 Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. \n",
      "2641 Yes!\n",
      "2642 Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.\n",
      "2643 That's true!\n",
      "2644 That's true!\n",
      "2645 Hey, there he is! There he is!\n",
      "2646 How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!\n",
      "2647 Hey!\n",
      "2648 Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.\n",
      "2649 Expect it in 4-6 weeks.  Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.\n",
      "2650 Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.\n",
      "2651 Why?\n",
      "2652 What's your point?\n",
      "2653  Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.\n",
      "2654 I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHÂ…",
      "MYÂ…",
      "GOD.\n",
      "2655 Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!\n",
      "2656 Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.\n",
      "2657 Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.\n",
      "2658 All right, let's show them how it's done.\n",
      "2659 Y'know that wasn't part of it?\n",
      "2660 Nope.\n",
      "2661 \n",
      "2662 Uhh, 9. \n",
      "2663 I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.\n",
      "2664 Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.\n",
      "2665 Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. \n",
      "2666 I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.\n",
      "2667 What's going on?\n",
      "2668 Uh, hey!\n",
      "2669 We're flipping Monica's mattress.\n",
      "2670 Aww, man! \n",
      "2671 Oh yes, somebody just said, \"Can you hear anything?\"\n",
      "2672 Condoms?\n",
      "2673 And condoms are the way to do that?\n",
      "2674  I can't believe it! We're here!\n",
      "2675 Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.\n",
      "2676 Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!\n",
      "2677  Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!\n",
      "2678 Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! \n",
      "2679 Okay, great. \n",
      "2680 Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!\n",
      "2681 What? Why?\n",
      "2682 Uh-huh. \n",
      "2683  Yeah.\n",
      "2684 I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.\n",
      "2685  Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!\n",
      "2686 Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?\n",
      "2687 Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?\n",
      "2688 Do not speak ill of the dead.\n",
      "2689 I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.\n",
      "2690 I said, \"Geez, relax Monnnnn.\"\n",
      "2691 Damn Rollos!\n",
      "2692 Hey.\n",
      "2693 It was terrible. I fought with \n",
      "2694 Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.\n",
      "2695 Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.\n",
      "2696 Monica. \n",
      "2697 Okay, fine, $300.\n",
      "2698 Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!\n",
      "2699 Hi!\n",
      "2700 Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.\n",
      "2701 Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.\n",
      "2702  Hey!\n",
      "2703 Yes that was mine.\n",
      "2704 Yes that would have made more sense.\n",
      "2705  Hey!\n",
      "2706 I just came over to drop offÂ…",
      "nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?\n",
      "2707 So, I guess this is over.\n",
      "2708 Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.\n",
      "2709 Because of the weekend, we had a fight.\n",
      "2710 So, this isn't over?\n",
      "2711 Really? Okay. Great!\n",
      "2712  We're in a relationship?\n",
      "2713 Okay.\n",
      "2714 Joey, can I talk to you for a second? \n",
      "2715 Yes. Yes. \n",
      "2716 It happened in London.\n",
      "2717 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "2718 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!\n",
      "2719 Fun's over!\n",
      "2720 Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?\n",
      "2721 Sorry.\n",
      "2722 Hello!\n",
      "2723 Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!\n",
      "2724 Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?\n",
      "2725 Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence\n",
      "2726 You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.\n",
      "2727 So you're really okay with this?\n",
      "2728 Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.\n",
      "2729 Okay, what is in here? Rocks?\n",
      "2730 So, rocks.\n",
      "2731 Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.\n",
      "2732 Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.\n",
      "2733 Well, I think it's very brave what you said.\n",
      "2734 Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?\n",
      "2735 Uh, Ross?\n",
      "2736 Yeah, we are so sorry.\n",
      "2737 Hi!\n",
      "2738 Oh yeah, there-there she is!\n",
      "2739 Are you looking at naked tribe's women?\n",
      "2740 That's a pig.\n",
      "2741 Hey! \n",
      "2742 What?!\n",
      "2743 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?\n",
      "2744 Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!\n",
      "2745 He thought you said gonad.\n",
      "2746 Love what you've done with the place.\n",
      "2747 Oh yeah!\n",
      "2748 Oh, the tears are real.\n",
      "2749 What are you doing?\n",
      "2750 You built a fort didn't ya?\n",
      "2751 \n",
      "2752 I hate this thing!\n",
      "2753  Hello children!\n",
      "2754 Okay. \n",
      "2755 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?\n",
      "2756 You mean this. \n",
      "2757  All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!\n",
      "2758 Okay.\n",
      "2759 No-no-no-no!\n",
      "2760 Okay, so he's out of here.\n",
      "2761 Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?\n",
      "2762 Not even on page 7?\n",
      "2763 What about that circled one?\n",
      "2764 Yes, it is.\n",
      "2765 There we go!\n",
      "2766 Let's go quicker.\n",
      "2767 Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.\n",
      "2768 Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.\n",
      "2769 It's a kitchen slash bathroom.\n",
      "2770 We are bad people.\n",
      "2771 Yes that was a nice place!\n",
      "2772 Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!\n",
      "2773 What are we gonna do?\n",
      "2774 About Ross!\n",
      "2775  Hello?\n",
      "2776 Ohhhhh!\n",
      "2777 98. 99. 100. Okay, go!\n",
      "2778 Here we go! Here we go!\n",
      "2779 Hey!\n",
      "2780 You're kidding, no!\n",
      "2781 Yeah!\n",
      "2782 Yes! Ross, you have to stay!\n",
      "2783 All right, buddy!\n",
      "2784 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?\n",
      "2785 All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?\n",
      "2786 That's sweet, Joey.\n",
      "2787 Are you aware that you're still talking?\n",
      "2788 No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.\n",
      "2789 It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.\n",
      "2790 Really? Worse than, \"More turkey Mr. Chandler?\"\n",
      "2791 It's exactly like it sounds.\n",
      "2792 Arghhhhhh!! \n",
      "2793 I'm over here big guy.\n",
      "2794  You did look like an idiot.\n",
      "2795 Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.\n",
      "2796  Okay.\n",
      "2797 Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.\n",
      "2798 Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.\n",
      "2799 Emotional Knapsack?\n",
      "2800 Right on! Oh! Uh, but, donÂ’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.\n",
      "2801 Dude, don't do that too me!\n",
      "2802 No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.\n",
      "2803 I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!\n",
      "2804 I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!\n",
      "2805 I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.\n",
      "2806 We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!\n",
      "2807 Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. \n",
      "2808 Oh my God!\n",
      "2809 You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!\n",
      "2810 Sorry!\n",
      "2811 Sorry.\n",
      "2812 Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.\n",
      "2813 Okay.\n",
      "2814 Are you all right?\n",
      "2815 What?\n",
      "2816 Without my toe?! I need my toe!\n",
      "2817 That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!\n",
      "2818 That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!\n",
      "2819 Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. \n",
      "2820 I can't believe this.\n",
      "2821 Yeah, well, sorry doesnÂ’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.\n",
      "2822 Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. \n",
      "2823 Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, \"Quack, quack!\" IÂ’m happy all the time!\n",
      "2824 Nice try.\n",
      "2825 Look, Monica\n",
      "2826 This is not going to work.\n",
      "2827 You are so great! I love you!\n",
      "2828 Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!\n",
      "2829 No I didn't!\n",
      "2830 No I didn't!\n",
      "2831 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\n",
      "2832 Top of the world? Dock of the bay?  I'm out.\n",
      "2833 Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!\n",
      "2834 See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!\n",
      "2835 Yeah!\n",
      "2836  All this lying has been hard on us too.\n",
      "2837 Well, yeah actually.\n",
      "2838 I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.\n",
      "2839 Help!\n",
      "2840 Hi, Pheebs!\n",
      "2841 I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.\n",
      "2842 Well, what did the police say?\n",
      "2843 Ross, it's just a sandwich!\n",
      "2844  Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?\n",
      "2845 Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?\n",
      "2846 What is going on here?\n",
      "2847 Yeah.\n",
      "2848 No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.\n",
      "2849 OhÂ—I don't know.\n",
      "2850 Hey.\n",
      "2851  You're naked in this picture!\n",
      "2852 Ross?\n",
      "2853 Which I may say, right now, is out of control.\n",
      "2854 And you're okay with that?\n",
      "2855 \n",
      "2856 All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.\n",
      "2857 Joey's a sex addict.\n",
      "2858 Well let'sÂ…",
      ".let's see what everybody thinks of that?\n",
      "2859 Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?\n",
      "2860 Why?\n",
      "2861 Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.\n",
      "2862 Okay, I'll stop.\n",
      "2863 You wanna play?\n",
      "2864 Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.\n",
      "2865 I'm intrigued.\n",
      "2866 Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.\n",
      "2867 Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?\n",
      "2868 \n",
      "2869  Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!\n",
      "2870 Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?\n",
      "2871  Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.\n",
      "2872 The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.\n",
      "2873 Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?\n",
      "2874 I paid for those tickets!\n",
      "2875 Oh yeah! \n",
      "2876 When did that happen to you?!\n",
      "2877 Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.\n",
      "2878 Okay, bye!  Oh my God!!\n",
      "2879 I don't believe they're brother and sister.\n",
      "2880 Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?\n",
      "2881 Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!\n",
      "2882 Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!\n",
      "2883 All right. \n",
      "2884 What is up?\n",
      "2885 No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.\n",
      "2886 Could I be more sorry. \n",
      "2887  I'm sorry too.\n",
      "2888 I am sorry, Ross.\n",
      "2889 This took you all day?!\n",
      "2890  We're very happy for you.\n",
      "2891 We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know\n",
      "2892  Happy New Year!\n",
      "2893 Do you want us to leave the room, or?\n",
      "2894 That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.\n",
      "2895 I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the \"new thing you do that day!\"  And it starts right now!\n",
      "2896 Nice!\n",
      "2897  Elizabeth Hornswoggle?\n",
      "2898 Horn-swoggle.\n",
      "2899 No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. \n",
      "2900 What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.\n",
      "2901  Someone comment on the pants!\n",
      "2902 That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.\n",
      "2903 Oh come on!! \n",

      "2918 Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!\n",
      "2919 And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.\n",
      "2920 Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks atÂ…",
      "bigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?\n",
      "2921 Okay, good luck with that. \n",

      "2924 You're not even giving them a chance!\n",
      "2925 Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?  Please let them win!\n",
      "2926 Oopsey, missed it!\n",
      "2927 Long! \n",
      "2928 Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. \n",
      "2929 It was my racquet.\n",
      "2930 If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.\n",
      "2931 Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.\n",
      "2932 Just a little bit of sugar.\n",

      "2944 Man, she is really gullible.\n",
      "2945 Okay.\n",
      "2946 Why would I be mad?\n",
      "2947  I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.\n",
      "2948 I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!\n",
      "2949 And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it downÂ—let's write it down!\n",

      "2969 Hey, is Rachel here?\n",
      "2970  Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.\n",
      "2971  I don't like your massages.\n",
      "2972 Okay, but now see you're crying!\n",
      "2973 What?\n",
      "2974 It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.\n",
      "2975 Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.\n",
      "2976 Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, \"Who's the best of that?\" They'd have to go to you.\n",
      "2977 Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!\n",
      "2978 Absolutely!\n",
      "2979 Yeah! \n",

      "2990 Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.\n",
      "2991 What's going on?\n",
      "2992 Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.\n",
      "2993 Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.\n",
      "2994 The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.\n",
      "2995 I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.\n",
      "2996 Ow!\n",
      "2997 Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.\n",
      "2998 No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!\n",
      "2999 Well it's not flexed right now!\n",
      "3000 Sure, I'll do it with ya.\n",
      "3001 That new mountain bike?\n",
      "3002 Your work makes me sad.\n",
      "3003  Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!\n",
      "3004 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?\n",
      "3005 Are you serious?\n",
      "3006  Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsÂ—She knows!\n",
      "3007  Joey!\n",
      "3008 Phoebe knows about us!\n",
      "3009 Oh man!\n",
      "3010 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!\n",
      "3011 Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. \n",
      "3012 Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.\n",
      "3013 Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.\n",
      "3014 Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!\n",
      "3015  Really?\n",
      "3016 Yes.\n",
      "3017 Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?\n",
      "3018 How do you know?!\n",

      "3028 Oh, do you not want to?\n",
      "3029  Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.\n",
      "3030 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!\n",
      "3031 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! \n",
      "3032 Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?\n",
      "3033 Oh, you're-you're going?\n",
      "3034  It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.\n",
      "3035 Not if I kiss you first.\n",
      "3036 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\n",
      "3037 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\n",
      "3038 Because I'm in love with Monica!!\n",

      "LOVEÂ…",
      "HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.\n",
      "3040 And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.\n",
      "3041 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n",
      "3042 \n",
      "3043 Oh, I'm going on the lamb.\n",

      "3046  Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!\n",
      "3047 Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.\n",
      "3048 Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.\n",
      "3049  Sounds like a fun party.\n",
      "3050 Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.\n",
      "3051 Wh-wh-why?!\n",
      "3052 Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!\n",
      "3053 I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! IÂ’m right. I'm right. Am I right?\n",
      "3054 Okay. It's not different at all, is it?\n",
      "3055 Hmm.\n",
      "3056 Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. \n",
      "3057 Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.\n",
      "3058 I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.\n",
      "3059 What?!\n",
      "3060 Well, you do want all that stuff, right?\n",
      "3061 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!\n",
      "3062 Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!\n",
      "3063 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!\n",
      "3064 Well, I did not know that.\n",
      "3065 It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.\n",
      "3066 By me?\n",
      "3067 Monica. \n",
      "3068 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.\n",
      "3069 Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.\n",
      "3070 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?\n",
      "3071 I need to talk to you, it's urgent!\n",
      "3072 Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. \n",
      "3073  Monica\n",
      "3074 Will you marry me?\n",
      "3075 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.\n",
      "3076 I'm doing this because I'm sorry?\n",
      "3077 No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?\n",
      "3078 Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.\n",
      "3079 Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. \n",
      "3080 I didn't think I was!\n",
      "3081 Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. \n",
      "3082 Okay, how long is this going to go on.\n",
      "3083 That's not funny.\n",
      "3084 Hey!\n",
      "3085 Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?\n",
      "3086 Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?\n",
      "3087 Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.\n",
      "3088 Hey!\n",
      "3089 Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.\n",
      "3090 Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.\n",
      "3091 Hi, Joe.\n",
      "3092 Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!\n",
      "3093 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I donÂ’t want to talk about it.\n",
      "3094 You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! \n",
      "3095 No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.\n",
      "3096 Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?\n",
      "3097 Well there you have it!\n",
      "3098 Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?\n",
      "3099 Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.\n",
      "3100  Hey!\n",
      "3101 Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so\n",
      "3102  Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.\n",
      "3103 Okay.\n",
      "3104 Yeah.\n",
      "3105  Okay.\n",
      "3106 Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!\n",
      "3107 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!\n",
      "3108 Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.\n",
      "3109 Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?\n",
      "3110  Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?\n",
      "3111 Ooh, I do! I do! I do!\n",
      "3112  He has a gun!\n",
      "3113  Hey Monica, here's your broom back.\n",
      "3114 Oh hey, how'd the interview go?\n",
      "3115 So what happened?\n",
      "3116 Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.\n",
      "3117 Come on, Rach.\n",
      "3118 I gotta check out this hot girl! \n",
      "3119  So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?\n",
      "3120 Oh, what can happen? I mean, would youÂ…",
      " \n",
      "3121 Uh, yeah.\n",
      "3122 Why?\n",
      "3123 Ohh, so?\n",
      "3124 Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.\n",
      "3125 That was amazing!\n",
      "3126 That was amazing.\n",
      "3127 No, you're the best.\n",
      "3128 No, you're the best.\n",
      "3129 Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.\n",
      "3130 Oh yeah, it's so cool. \n",
      "3131 Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?\n",
      "3132 No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!\n",
      "3133 Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!\n",
      "3134  So?\n",
      "3135 Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?\n",
      "3136 Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.\n",
      "3137 Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. \n",
      "3138 Yeah?\n",
      "3139 Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.\n",
      "3140 Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!\n",
      "3141 Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  And now we're back.\n",
      "3142  You guys ready fore the movies?\n",
      "3143 Okay. \n",

      "3149 Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.\n",

      "3199  So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?\n",
      "3200 Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.\n",
      "3201 Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?\n",
      "3202  Well, what is it?\n",
      "3203  If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?\n",
      "3204 Doesn't know, \"Hello.\" But she knows Capricorn One.\n",
      "3205 So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?\n",
      "3206 See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!\n",
      "3207 Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.\n",
      "3208 Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, \"I'm just flirting, no big deal.\" But the guy is thinking, \"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!\"\n",
      "3209 It's true.\n",
      "3210 Again true.\n",
      "3211 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.\n",
      "3212 Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  So, you're old and small.\n",
      "3213 Okay, hold on. \n",
      "3214  If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.\n",
      "3215 Oh the humanity.\n",
      "3216 More so than anything else.\n",
      "3217 Almost over man.\n",
      "3218 Why am I looking?\n",
      "3219 You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.\n",
      "3220  Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdownÂ…",
      "enginesÂ…",
      "on!\n",
      "3221  Hey!\n",
      "3222 You ready?\n",
      "3223 You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.\n",
      "3224 Let me see the earrings.\n",
      "3225  They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?\n",
      "3226  Thanks for picking out the earrings man.\n",
      "3227 Hey man, what's up?\n",
      "3228 Yeah, yeah! Me too!\n",
      "3229 Yeah.\n",
      "3230 Well, I like danger.\n",
      "3231 Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.\n",
      "3232 It is starting to get dark out there.\n",
      "3233  But it is officially nighttime.\n",
      "3234 Your tax dollars?\n",
      "3235  Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.\n",
      "3236 I can't smell your sandwich?\n",
      "3237 Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?\n",
      "3238 Okay.\n",
      "3239 Yeah.\n",
      "3240 Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?\n",
      "3241 How do you figure that?\n",
      "3242 Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.\n",
      "3243 Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.\n",
      "3244 Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!\n",
      "3245  Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.\n",
      "3246 What's going on?\n",
      "3247 Uh, HELLO!!\n",
      "3248  It was a car backfire!\n",
      "3249 Who jumps at loud noises!\n",
      "3250 Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. \n",
      "3251 \n",
      "3252 Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever\n",
      "3253 No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.\n",
      "3254 You dove in front of Ross! Ross!\n",
      "3255 I do not hate Ross!\n",
      "3256 What picture?\n",
      "3257 Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!\n",
      "3258 When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.\n",
      "3259 From a bullet!\n",
      "3260 Much sense?!\n",
      "3261 So you risked your life, for a sandwich!\n",
      "3262 So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.\n",
      "3263 Really?!\n",
      "3264 Thanks. \n",
      "3265  Oh-oi-ho, yeah!\n",
      "3266 Hm-hmm. \n",
      "3267 I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.\n",
      "3268 Before or after you were shot by your own troops?\n",
      "3269 Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.\n",
      "3270  Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?\n",
      "3271 Okay.\n",
      "3272 Hiya doin' pumpkin?\n",
      "3273  Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!\n",
      "3274 Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! \n",
      "3275 So, what are you gonna do?\n",
      "3276 Me?! Why me?\n",
      "3277 I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.\n",
      "3278 \n",
      "3279 Hey ladies! What are you in here for? \n",
      "3280 Gary, I'm here to report a crime.\n",
      "3281 It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.\n",
      "3282 Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.\n",
      "3283 Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!\n",
      "3284 You mean scared.\n",
      "3285 Scared? Happy?\n",
      "3286 I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!\n",
      "3287 Were you're parents happy, or something?\n",
      "3288 Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.\n",
      "3289 Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!\n",
      "3290  Yeah, you're right about that.\n",
      "3291 Hi!\n",
      "3292 Yes I did, and I think you should do it.\n",
      "3293 He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.\n",
      "3294 IÂ’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.\n",
      "3295 Hey Gar!\n",
      "3296 Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?\n",
      "3297 All right, let me in. \n",
      "3298 What?\n",
      "3299 I'm not a dropper!\n",
      "3300 It's throwing and catching!\n",
      "3301 Oh! Oh! That's so hard. \n",
      "3302 Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.\n",
      "3303 Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.\n",
      "3304 Not fun anymore?\n",
      "3305 Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!\n",
      "3306 Oh that is over!\n",
      "3307 You guys wanna eat here?\n",
      "3308 Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. \n",
      "3309 Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!\n",
      "3310 Okay, so Richard, Richard!\n",
      "3311 What?\n",
      "3312 How much did I love The King and I? \n",
      "3313 You okay there man?\n",
      "3314 Wow umm, calm down.\n",
      "3315 Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?\n",
      "3316 You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!\n",
      "3317 Yeah, I know that means buddy!\n",
      "3318 Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.\n",
      "3319 Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?\n",
      "3320 All right, great, road trip baby!  This okay with you?\n",
      "3321 Thank you.\n",
      "3322  Hey!\n",
      "3323 Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? \n",
      "3324 What?\n",
      "3325 Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?\n",
      "3326 I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?\n",
      "3327 So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?\n",
      "3328 All right, bye-bye now!\n",
      "3329 Okay!\n",
      "3330 We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.\n",
      "3331 Yeah.\n",
      "3332 Isn't that Ross's money?\n",
      "3333 I don't know.\n",
      "3334 Okay!\n",
      "3335 Too dry.\n",
      "3336 No!\n",
      "3337 No!\n",
      "3338 Yes.\n",
      "3339 I also said, \"Yes!\"\n",
      "3340 No!  Ahhh!!!\n",
      "3341 Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.\n",
      "3342 They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!\n",
      "3343 Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.\n",
      "3344 Oh, you don't want me on the trip?\n",
      "3345 All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.\n",
      "3346 All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!\n",
      "3347 You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.\n",
      "3348 All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.\n",
      "3349  Hey!\n",
      "3350 Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!\n",
      "3351 I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.\n",
      "3352 Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.\n",
      "3353 Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?\n",
      "3354  Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!\n",
      "3355 Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?\n",
      "3356 That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn\n",
      "3357 Really?\n",
      "3358  Hey!\n",
      "3359  Let me talk to him!\n",
      "3360  Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.\n",
      "3361  Hey!\n",
      "3362 No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!\n",
      "3363 Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!\n",
      "3364 Uh, what was that?\n",
      "3365  Hey!\n",
      "3366 I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.\n",
      "3367 Huh.\n",
      "3368 Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!\n",
      "3369 Okay.\n",
      "3370 Wow!\n",
      "3371 Do we have to?\n",
      "3372 Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.\n",
      "3373 Yeah, I think we should see other people.\n",
      "3374 Yes.\n",
      "3375 It's a great idea. \n",
      "3376 Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.\n",
      "3377  Art lover!\n",
      "3378 I said art lover.\n",
      "3379 I don't know, I'm very tired.\n",
      "3380 So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.\n",
      "3381 Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.\n",
      "3382  Happy plane-aversary.\n",
      "3383 Can I give you a present now?\n",
      "3384 Okay!  Oh man! DonÂ’t tell me I did this!\n",
      "3385 How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?\n",
      "3386 Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!\n",
      "3387 What-what Richard thing?\n",
      "3388 What Richard thing?\n",
      "3389  I'm not mad.\n",
      "3390 Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. \n",
      "3391 Oh my God.\n",
      "3392 Love your condoms my man.\n",
      "3393 Why?! What happened?!\n",
      "3394 No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.\n",
      "3395 No! Her boyfriend Richard!\n",
      "3396 When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!\n",
      "3397 Thanks. \n",
      "3398  Next time?\n",
      "3399 There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!\n",
      "3400 That's so funny, because I think I just did!\n",
      "3401 Fine with me!\n",
      "3402 What are you talking\n",
      "3403 Really?\n",
      "3404  Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.\n",
      "3405 Whoa!\n",
      "3406 Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! \n",
      "3407 Good luck!\n",
      "3408 I see.\n",
      "3409  What?\n",
      "3410 What's an identical hand twin?\n",
      "3411 Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?\n",
      "3412  How?\n",
      "3413 Again I must go back to, how?\n",
      "3414  Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.\n",
      "3415 No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!\n",
      "3416 No!\n",
      "3417 That was Joey!\n",
      "3418 Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.\n",
      "3419 Really?\n",
      "3420 Okay. \n",
      "3421  See you later Mon.\n",
      "3422 What does it look like? I'm going home.\n",
      "3423 Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life.\n",
      "3424 Really?!\n",
      "3425 Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.\n",
      "3426  Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "3427 Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. \n",
      "3428 Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!\n",
      "3429 Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?\n",
      "3430 8. 8!\n",
      "3431 If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!\n",
      "3432 Noo!\n",
      "3433 Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.\n",
      "3434 Two fours.\n",
      "3435 Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place!  get the biggest suite in the place.\n",
      "3436  Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!\n",
      "3437 Another hard 8.\n",
      "3438 Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight;  and we get married here tonight.\n",
      "3439 You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.\n",
      "3440 Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.\n",
      "3441 Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?\n",
      "3442 Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!\n",
      "3443  Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?\n",
      "3444 All right!\n",
      "3445 Here it is! Here it is!\n",
      "3446 It's a four.\n",
      "3447 Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.\n",
      "3448 Let's go! \n",
      "3449 Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.\n",
      "3450 I don't think so.\n",
      "3451 \n",
      "3452 No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.\n",
      "3453 Okay, one thing at a time. \n",
      "3454 Hello! One marriage please!\n",
      "3455  Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!\n",
      "3456 Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?\n",
      "3457 Okay!  We're gonna get married!\n",
      "3458 Oh my God!\n",
      "3459 Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!\n",
      "3460 Hey!\n",
      "3461 Yes! Well that-yes.\n",
      "3462 We actually missed it.\n",
      "3463 What?!\n",
      "3464 Hi!\n",
      "3465 So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?\n",
      "3466 ItÂ’s a buffet man.\n",
      "3467 Listen, I gotta talk to you.\n",
      "3468 Monica and I almost got married last night.\n",
      "3469 Look, I just donÂ’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! YÂ’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. YÂ’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?\n",
      "3470 What?!\n",
      "3471  Hi.\n",
      "3472 Hey!\n",
      "3473 Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or\n",
      "3474  You did.\n",
      "3475 Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this oneÂ’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third oneÂ’s free.\n",
      "3476 I donÂ’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!\n",
      "3477 So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.\n",
      "3478 Yes, we donÂ’t get married unless thereÂ’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then thereÂ’s a definite sign that we should get married.\n",
      "3479 Sounds great.\n",
      "3480 Ready!\n",
      "3481  Yes, yes eight.\n",
      "3482 That was so unlikely. Well, letÂ’s get married! I guess.\n",
      "3483 ThatÂ’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!\n",
      "3484 Yeah.  WeÂ’re doing the right thing, right?\n",
      "3485 Well you did pull his hair.\n",
      "3486 IÂ’m not getting into this again!\n",
      "3487 Well, I told you not to walk. Here. \n",
      "3488 No!\n",
      "3489 All right, should we just, should we just get married? YÂ’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.\n",
      "3490 Me too!\n",
      "3491 No!\n",
      "3492 Jeez, relax! ItÂ’s not like weÂ’re mar-ah-ah!! \n",
      "3493  YÂ’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\n",
      "3494 Well, what if all my stuff was here?\n",
      "3495 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂ’m saying?\n",
      "3496 Me asking is kind of a sign.\n",
      "3497 Okay!!!!!\n",
      "3498 Okay.\n",
      "3499 Oh thanks.\n",
      "3500 The door hasnÂ’t been locked in five years, but okay!  Ready?!\n",
      "3501 Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I canÂ’t get in!\n",
      "3502 This is not a sign!\n",
      "3503 ItÂ’s an old key!\n",
      "3504 I love you!\n",
      "3505 Are you hugging the door right now.\n",
      "3506 Yeah-yeah, me neither.\n",
      "3507 The keyÂ’s stuck in the lock.\n",
      "3508  It still doesnÂ’t work.\n",
      "3509 Oh.\n",
      "3510 Nice job Joe! YouÂ’re quite the craftsmen.\n",
      "3511 YÂ’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?\n",
      "3512 No. When it comes to sweets, heÂ’s surprisingly strict.\n",
      "3513 No, no, I keep trying, yÂ’know? I can get out, \"Joey, I have tooÂ…",
      "\" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, \"Â…",
      "go to the bathroom.\" He may think IÂ’m sick.\n",
      "3514 Oh, so thatÂ’s this is gonna work now? YouÂ’re just gonna order me around all the time?\n",
      "3515 All right.\n",
      "3516 No-o-o!  No-o-o! Look Joey, hereÂ’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, IÂ’m gonna be moving out man.\n",
      "3517 Look, I-IÂ’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up IÂ’m moving right back in with you!\n",
      "3518  Hey!\n",
      "3519  What gave me away?\n",
      "3520 Okay, so thatÂ’s it, everybody knows! ItÂ’s official, weÂ’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?\n",
      "3521 Wow that was my scariest voice! YouÂ’re very brave.\n",
      "3522 Hey.\n",
      "3523 Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.\n",
      "3524 Well, I-I still think youÂ’re very-very nice and very pretty\n",
      "3525 \n",
      "3526 Rach\n",
      "3527 Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?\n",
      "3528 Well, JoeyÂ’s my best friend.\n",
      "3529 You just saidÂ…",
      " Of course youÂ’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?\n",
      "3530 Okay. \n",
      "3531 Hey-hey!\n",
      "3532 I am now!\n",
      "3533 Okay, bye! \n",
      "3534 Look, IÂ’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.\n",
      "3535 Not once did we do that.\n",
      "3536 Hey!\n",
      "3537 Oh yeah? Well, howÂ’d she take it?\n",
      "3538 And youÂ’re upset because you didnÂ’t make your best friend cry?\n",
      "3539 Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!\n",
      "3540  Hey!\n",
      "3541 Pheebs, I donÂ’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?\n",
      "3542 Hey-hey! I thought Naked ThursdayÂ’s was just our thing man!\n",
      "3543 Who was it?\n",
      "3544 Sure!\n",
      "3545 Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yÂ’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!\n",
      "3546 Okay so you mean no as in, \"Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. LetÂ’s discuss it before we reject it completely.\"\n",
      "3547 So, thatÂ’s it?\n",
      "3548 Which is why Asteroids is perfect! ItÂ’s the oldest game!\n",
      "3549 I donÂ’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!\n",
      "3550 No, IÂ’m not mocking you, \n",
      "3551 Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.\n",
      "3552  \"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly.\" Nice!\n",
      "3553 Hi.\n",
      "3554 Hi, listen, IÂ’m sorry about before. I donÂ’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnÂ’t get girls, and now I can Â‘emÂ—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women\n",
      "3555 Really?\n",
      "3556 Ohh.\n",
      "3557 ThatÂ’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.\n",
      "3558 We donÂ’t have to come up with this now.\n",
      "3559 Hey, yÂ’know what? Why donÂ’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?\n",
      "3560 Yeah, I mean weÂ’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. \n",
      "3561 Is that a problem?\n",
      "3562 Oh, thatÂ’s cool. Then IÂ’ll just bring them both over.\n",
      "3563 Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! IÂ’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!\n",
      "3564 In the game room!\n",
      "3565 All right! ThatÂ’s fine! ThatÂ’s fine! I wonÂ’t bring over the chairs! I wonÂ’t bring anything over! I wouldnÂ’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at GrandmaÂ’s place!! \n",
      "3566 \n",
      "3567 Why did you take the shower curtain down?\n",
      "3568 Well, why donÂ’t you tell her to stop being silly! \n",
      "3569 Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.\n",
      "3570 ThatÂ’s laughter.\n",
      "3571 I donÂ’t know.\n",
      "3572 Yeah, I do.\n",
      "3573 HeÂ’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!\n",
      "3574 Yeah, I'm not so worried.\n",
      "3575 Of course!\n",
      "3576 Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.\n",
      "3577 Okay!\n",
      "3578 Oh my God! SomeoneÂ’s killed Square Man!\n",
      "3579 Oh thatÂ’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!\n",
      "3580 YÂ’know those big-big uh, road signs that say \"Merge?\"\n",
      "3581 YÂ’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thatÂ’s you and I together! Merge!\n",
      "3582 Really?!\n",
      "3583 Hey!\n",
      "3584 Oh, whatÂ’s the matter?\n",
      "3585 Yeah?\n",
      "3586 What?!\n",
      "3587 Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youÂ’re gonna go?\n",
      "3588 Oh hi!\n",
      "3589 Why donÂ’t you open with a joke?\n",
      "3590 Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂ’re not talking about Chuckles University?!\n",
      "3591 ThatÂ’s the way I did it Â‘til I was 19.\n",
      "3592 Hey.\n",
      "3593 Yes, you got something from the Screen ActorÂ’s Guild.\n",
      "3594  \"Benefits lapsed.\"\n",
      "3595 Okay, itÂ’s not a check. TheyÂ’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didnÂ’t work enough last year.\n",
      "3596 All right.\n",
      "3597 IÂ’m sorry man, thereÂ’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.\n",
      "3598 Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.\n",
      "3599 Hey!\n",
      "3600 ThatÂ’s great, but shouldnÂ’t you be on the toilet right now?\n",
      "3601 WhatÂ’s wrong with you?\n",
      "3602 This sounds like a hernia. You have toÂ—you-you go to the doctor!\n",
      "3603 ThatÂ’s a hernia.\n",
      "3604 Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!\n",
      "3605 I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and letÂ’s just get that thingÂ…",
      "pushed back in.\n",
      "3606 Hey.\n",
      "3607 Oh JoeyÂ’s got a really bad hernia, but thatÂ’s nothing a little laser eye surgery wonÂ’t fix!\n",
      "3608 Listen, IÂ’m really glad you got the part.\n",
      "3609 But are you sure you can do this?\n",
      "3610 Now, is that never talking about it again?!\n",
      "3611 IÂ’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why donÂ’t you uh, lift up your shirt?  We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!\n",
      "3612 What are you doing?\n",
      "3613 Oh, all right.\n",
      "3614 What?\n",
      "3615 Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?\n",
      "3616 Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youÂ’re not married to anymore of us are ya?\n",
      "3617 You left a shoe here?!\n",
      "3618 Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, IÂ’ll be sure to give him your shoe.\n",
      "3619  Yeah, all right.\n",
      "3620 Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?\n",
      "3621 Yeah, IÂ’m gonna pass. Â‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.\n",
      "3622 Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. \n",
      "3623 See thatÂ’s where I think that youÂ’re wrong. WeÂ’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.\n",
      "3624 I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yÂ’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands aroundÂ…",
      " \n",
      "3625 Okay, IÂ’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.\n",
      "3626 Hey!\n",
      "3627 Shocking! Since you still have the keys.\n",
      "3628 What equity investments?\n",
      "3629 You donÂ’t even have a car!\n",
      "3630 And?\n",
      "3631 There you are.\n",
      "3632 \n",
      "3633 He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!\n",
      "3634 TheyÂ’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!\n",
      "3635 Glass, sand, whatever. \n",
      "3636  I thought about it and maybe youÂ’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.\n",
      "3637 I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.\n",
      "3638 Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. YÂ’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now itÂ’s lodged in my throat. \n",
      "3639 But you found the keys to his clothes?\n",
      "3640 That is true.\n",
      "3641 Ahh, I think it just moved. ItÂ’s really poking me.\n",
      "3642 I think thatÂ’s gum.\n",
      "3643 Okay, listen this really hurts. LetÂ’s go.\n",
      "3644  Hey!\n",
      "3645 Well, letÂ’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.\n",
      "3646 And protected them from a tornado?\n",
      "3647 Was the setting of PhoebeÂ’s triumph.\n",
      "3648 Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.\n",
      "3649  Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!\n",
      "3650  Listen, IÂ’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.\n",
      "3651 First of the month.\n",
      "3652 No, just the months you actually want to live here.\n",
      "3653 Okay, here is the phone bill. \n",
      "3654 ThatÂ’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why donÂ’t I justÂ—why donÂ’t I just cover you for a while?\n",
      "3655 ItÂ’s not charity, Joe\n",
      "3656 Okay uh, hereÂ’s the electric bill. \n",
      "3657 Uh, yeah.\n",
      "3658 So, weÂ’ll do the rest of the bills later then?\n",
      "3659 No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnÂ’t take it.\n",
      "3660 I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yÂ’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wonÂ’t hurt his pride.\n",
      "3661 Well that would help the pride thing.\n",
      "3662 Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?\n",
      "3663 Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?\n",
      "3664 Hey!\n",
      "3665 Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure weÂ’d do nothing.\n",
      "3666 Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.\n",
      "3667 Yes, but for the last time.\n",
      "3668 HeÂ’s at a dinner party.\n",
      "3669 Oh, I wish IÂ’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.\n",
      "3670 Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?\n",
      "3671 Yes it would. What do you say to $50?\n",
      "3672 Okay, letÂ’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.\n",
      "3673 Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.\n",
      "3674 Oh yes!\n",
      "3675 Okay.\n",
      "3676 No! No! No! NoÂ—Â—one can beat me.\n",
      "3677 See? Now, thatÂ’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.\n",
      "3678 Still broken?\n",
      "3679 Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? \n",
      "3680 Okay, uh, how about, how aboutÂ—yÂ’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, itÂ’s fun.\n",
      "3681 Cups.\n",
      "3682 IÂ’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, itÂ’s really easy and really, really fun.\n",
      "3683 Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?\n",
      "3684 Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!\n",
      "3685 Oh yeah! Okay, letÂ’s play again.  What do you got?\n",
      "3686 YouÂ’re kidding right?\n",
      "3687 Well thatÂ’s a full cup! \n",
      "3688 You win.\n",
      "3689 It doesnÂ’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?\n",
      "3690 Not 700 exactly?\n",
      "3691 Double it! \n",
      "3692 Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.\n",
      "3693 Hey, I didnÂ’t make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. \n",
      "3694 WhatÂ’s wrong?\n",
      "3695 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!\n",
      "3696 Oh man!!\n",
      "3697 All right, letÂ’s play one more hand! One more!\n",
      "3698 I canÂ’t take the big white dog! You love it!\n",
      "3699 No, but waitÂ—what if I bought it from you, yÂ’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?\n",
      "3700 When did I try to give you money?\n",
      "3701 IÂ’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youÂ’re okay.\n",
      "3702  Hey.\n",
      "3703 I know. \n",
      "3704 No problem roomie. \n",
      "3705 Sure!\n",
      "3706 I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.\n",
      "3707 Exactly.\n",
      "3708 ItÂ’s not a real game! I made it up!\n",
      "3709 At a fake game!!\n",
      "3710 Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.\n",
      "3711 Hmm, letÂ’s see if it comes up this time. \n",
      "3712  And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.\n",
      "3713 I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.\n",
      "3714 Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.\n",
      "3715 So, uh, wh-where ya from?\n",
      "3716 Unbelievable\n",
      "3717 Hey, look at all the boxes!\n",
      "3718 All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?\n",
      "3719 Now imagine you live at the supermarket.\n",
      "3720 No-no\n",
      "3721 OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. \n",
      "3722  Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.\n",
      "3723 Yeah, not bad right? You know what, MonicaÂ’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?\n",
      "3724 Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?\n",
      "3725 What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!\n",
      "3726 Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.\n",
      "3727 Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.\n",
      "3728 She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.\n",
      "3729 She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.\n",
      "3730 I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.\n",
      "3731 No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.\n",
      "3732 Hey Mon, how's it going?\n",
      "3733 Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.\n",
      "3734 No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.\n",
      "3735 It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.\n",
      "3736 We should start with the big stuff. YÂ’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. \n",
      "3737 What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.\n",
      "3738 OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.\n",
      "3739 Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!\n",
      "3740 Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?\n",
      "3741 Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.\n",
      "3742 That's not specific to girls.\n",
      "3743 And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.\n",
      "3744 Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.\n",
      "3745 Okay, is this lamp in the same place?\n",
      "3746  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.\n",
      "3747  I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.\n",
      "3748 Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.\n",
      "3749 Bye! Thank God\n",
      "3750 Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.\n",
      "3751 That's perfect! That's brilliant! \n",
      "3752 Uh-huh\n",
      "3753 No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. \n",
      "3754 Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n",
      "3755 Do you want me to be afraid of you?\n",
      "3756 Really?\n",
      "3757 Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.\n",
      "3758 Ba dum bumb cheshhh!\n",
      "3759 Hi, my nameÂ’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?\n",
      "3760 So, is Janine around?\n",
      "3761 Can I check out what she did to my room?\n",
      "3762  ItÂ’s spreading already.\n",
      "3763  Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?\n",
      "3764  Is that your tiny little box, thatÂ’s too small to put anything in?\n",
      "3765 No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youÂ’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.\n",
      "3766 Yes talk to her. Be a man.\n",
      "3767 Defend yourself.\n",
      "3768 Be right there sweetums.  A totally different situation.\n",
      "3769 Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?\n",
      "3770 Ohh, yeah.\n",

      "3783 Yes, but I feel like IÂ’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think weÂ’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.\n",
      "3784 Nah, Nah, itÂ’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.\n",

      "3847 You donÂ’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?\n",
      "3848 Because thatÂ’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that IÂ’ve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! \n",

      "3852 Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?\n",
      "3853 Oh, hey guys!\n",
      "3854 Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.\n",
      "3855 Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thatÂ’s as good as garbage?\n",
      "3856 What?\n",
      "3857 Oh great!\n",
      "3858 Okay! Okay! Okay!\n",

      "3860 I donÂ’t wanna know what Monica got me. YÂ’know? I mean, look, IÂ’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.\n",
      "3861 Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I donÂ’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on MonicaÂ’s face when I give her my present, and IÂ’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?\n",
      "3862 Fine!\n",
      "3863 ThatÂ’s what you got me?\n",
      "3864 Now you do that, youÂ’re on TV.\n",
      "3865 ThatÂ’s great!\n",

      "3867 So sheÂ’s just waiting over there for ya?\n",
      "3868 \n",
      "3869 IÂ’m not your garbage man. IÂ’m your mailman.\n",
      "3870 A pharmacist. \n",
      "3871 You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!\n",
      "3872 You made pottery?\n",
      "3873 Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore\n",
      "3874 so then the farmer says, \"ThatÂ’s not a cow and youÂ’re not milking it.\" \n",
      "3875 Look at us, weÂ’re a couple of couples!\n",
      "3876 Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.\n",
      "3877 And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnÂ’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.\n",
      "3878 Oh thatÂ’s too bad.\n",
      "3879 ThatÂ’s funny, I saw no phlegm.\n",
      "3880 Then why-why is she going to a play?!\n",
      "3881 Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!\n",
      "3882 So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!\n",
      "3883 And I am not blah, I am a hoot!\n",
      "3884 No, you shÂ—No you said you made that up!!\n",

      "3888 Perfect decibel.\n",
      "3889 Hey.\n",
      "3890 Oh nothing, weÂ’re just talking. YÂ’know, blah-blah-blah.\n",
      "3891 ThatÂ’s totally understandable.\n",
      "3892 Oh yeah!\n",
      "3893 And IÂ’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  \"Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.\"\n",
      "3894  YÂ’know I think you can take her.\n",
      "3895 Did you hear that?\n",
      "3896 Yeah, IÂ’m sorry man.  You wanna go watch?\n",
      "3897 Hey so, did uh, did she move out?\n",
      "3898 You okay?\n",
      "3899 That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.\n",
      "3900 I made that joke up.\n",
      "3901 Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke heÂ’d ever heard.\n",
      "3902 Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?\n",
      "3903 Seriously?\n",
      "3904 Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "3905  Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.\n",
      "3906 ItÂ’s my joke.\n",
      "3907 Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.\n",
      "3908 Nah, MonicaÂ’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I donÂ’t want to miss when they were skinny.\n",
      "3909 What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?\n",
      "3910 Joey, why is your cable out?\n",
      "3911 If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?\n",
      "3912 Whoa ho.\n",
      "3913  All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?\n",
      "3914  Paid your phone bill?\n",
      "3915 Yeah.\n",
      "3916 So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.\n",
      "3917 And monkeys canÂ’t write out prescriptions.\n",
      "3918  You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.\n",
      "3919 So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.\n",
      "3920 Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.\n",
      "3921 Yeah!\n",
      "3922 Okay .\n",
      "3923  He took my joke, he took it.\n",
      "3924 You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? IÂ’m going to get a joke journal. YÂ’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.\n",
      "3925 Yeah!\n",
      "3926 Picking Rachel.\n",
      "3927 Maybe itÂ’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.\n",
      "3928 So is your apron. YouÂ’re wearing it like a cape.\n",
      "3929 I think itÂ’s great that you work here. YouÂ’re going to make a lot of money, and hereÂ’s your first tip: DonÂ’t eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.\n",
      "3930 ItÂ’s my joke.\n",
      "3931 LetÂ’s have Monica decide.\n",
      "3932 Yeah!\n",
      "3933 Mon, get out here!\n",
      "3934 Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.\n",
      "3935 Because youÂ’re the only one that can be fair.\n",
      "3936  IÂ’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, letÂ’s go.\n",
      "3937 Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.\n",
      "3938 Can I finish my story?!\n",
      "3939 So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And SteveÂ’s doctorÂ’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Â‘Doctor Monkey?Â’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. \n",
      "3940 IÂ’m not arguing with that.\n",
      "3941 Is not.\n",
      "3942 Hi, oh hi.\n",
      "3943 Â—generosity of spirit.\n",
      "3944  IÂ’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?\n",
      "3945  YouÂ’re a little high maintenance.\n",
      "3946 IÂ’m sorry. YouÂ’re not easy-going, but youÂ’re passionate, and thatÂ’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that IÂ’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thatÂ’s good too. So, they can say that youÂ’re high maintenance, but itÂ’s okay, because I like Â…",
      " maintaining you.\n",
      "3947 \n",
      "3948 Hey, buddy boy, howÂ’d the audition go?\n",
      "3949 Hey.\n",
      "3950 Joey!  No way. IÂ’m not answering that.\n",
      "3951 This coming from the man who couldnÂ’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.\n",
      "3952 Hey, what are you doing here? ShouldnÂ’t you be at work?\n",
      "3953 IÂ’m so sorry youÂ’re sick.\n",
      "3954 IÂ’m gonna grab you some tissue.\n",
      "3955 Yes?\n",
      "3956 Oh my God, introduce us!\n",
      "3957 Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! \n",
      "3958 I know, letÂ’s rest and drink lots of fluids. \n",
      "3959 That would be impossible to resist if you werenÂ’t all drippy here. \n",
      "3960 Yeah, I donÂ’t you should say that even when youÂ’re healthy.\n",
      "3961 DonÂ’t take this personally okay? ItÂ’s just that I just canÂ’t have sex with a sick person.\n",
      "3962 ThatÂ’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.\n",
      "3963 Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh!\n",
      "3964 Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.\n",
      "3965 I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! YÂ’know whatÂ’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.\n",
      "3966 Would you please get some rest!\n",
      "3967 Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!\n",
      "3968 No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.\n",
      "3969 No-no-no-no-no!\n",
      "3970 Okay.\n",
      "3971 So youÂ’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?\n",
      "3972 ItÂ’s nice.\n",
      "3973 Yes! \n",
      "3974 ItÂ’s all very, very good.  So you wanna go uh, mix it up?\n",
      "3975 Oh come on you big faker!\n",
      "3976 Well that was before all the vaporizing action.\n",

      "3982 IÂ’m good.\n",
      "3983  Is that a swing?\n",
      "3984 Yuck!\n",
      "3985 That was like 5 years ago.\n",
      "3986 Joey\n",
      "3987  Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!\n",
      "3988 Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!\n",
      "3989 IÂ’m not macho.\n",
      "3990 No, I guess I just never really cried. YÂ’know? IÂ’m not a crying kind of guy.\n",
      "3991 IÂ’d be sad sure, but I wouldnÂ’t cry.\n",
      "3992 Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, IÂ’m rich!\n",
      "3993 Oh, thatÂ’s ParentÂ’s Day, first grade. ThatÂ’s me with the janitor Martin.\n",
      "3994 Oh they didnÂ’t want to come!\n",
      "3995 No! Look, I donÂ’t cry! ItÂ’s not a big deal! Okay?!\n",
      "3996 You didnÂ’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?\n",

      "4001 Hey! \n",
      "4002 ThereÂ’s no back to this couch!\n",
      "4003 Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yÂ’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnÂ’t think I was yÂ’know, all dead inside.\n",
      "4004 Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.\n",
      "4005 No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, weÂ’re up at the altar and IÂ’m like this. \n",

      "4010 So you didnÂ’t mean any of that?!\n",
      "4011 Hey.\n",
      "4012  Maybe we should give them some privacy.\n",
      "4013  I just donÂ’t see why those two canÂ’t work things out!\n",
      "4014  I canÂ’t help it, I opened a gate.\n",
      "4015 Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.\n",
      "4016 Sure I would!\n",
      "4017 What, you guys really think that IÂ’m that shallow?\n",
      "4018 What if I had had the guts to quit my job? IÂ’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobÂ’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I donÂ’t have to wear a tie.\n",
      "4019  Hey.\n",
      "4020 Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not \"Archie Comic funny.\"\n",
      "4021 Was his question whatÂ’s more boring than him?\n",
      "4022 Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.\n",
      "4023 Ehh.\n",
      "4024 I could use the money; it could give me time to write.\n",
      "4025 Okay!\n",
      "4026 All right!\n",
      "4027 Hey.\n",
      "4028 Well itÂ’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that heÂ’s not real.\n",
      "4029 Uh-oh, itÂ’s my boss!\n",

      "4034 I always thought having a heart attack was natureÂ’s way of telling you to die!  But youÂ’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youÂ’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.\n",
      "4035 Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, \"Bring me food.\" Two is, \"IÂ’m with a girl, bring us food.\" Three is, \"IÂ’m lost and I canÂ’t find food.\"\n",
      "4036 \n",
      "4037 Yeah?\n",

      "4044 WhatÂ’s this?\n",
      "4045 Aww, thanks man. \n",
      "4046 Oh you wouldnÂ’t uh, care. ItÂ’s just a stupid comic book story.\n",
      "4047 Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesnÂ’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistÂ—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that canÂ’t have lumps in them.\n",
      "4048 No, the doctors say it may kill her.\n",
      "4049  But I think we should tell her.\n",
      "4050 Listen Phoebe, heÂ’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.\n",
      "4051 Uh, what about yÂ’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.\n",
      "4052 IÂ’m sorry youÂ’re here with me instead of Roger.\n",
      "4053 Well, I could make it seem like heÂ’s here. \n",
      "4054 Okay.\n",
      "4055 What was tonight?\n",
      "4056 Okay.  What was tonight?\n",
      "4057 With Roger?  Oh my God!\n",
      "4058 Four different women! IÂ’ve had sex way more times!\n",
      "4059 Nine.\n",
      "4060 Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?\n",
      "4061 Hey thatÂ’s what I tell girls about me.\n",
      "4062 No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.\n",
      "4063 Okay. \n",
      "4064 So was I.\n",
      "4065 We canÂ’t do this.\n",
      "4066 Yeah!  If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, yÂ’know? Because youÂ’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldnÂ’t want to disappoint you.\n",
      "4067 I do like that.\n",
      "4068 Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?\n",
      "4069 Stop it! WeÂ’re doing this! LetÂ’s do it!\n",
      "4070 Okay! \n",
      "4071 I have some moves.\n",
      "4072 Yeah, letÂ’s just forget it.\n",
      "4073 Okay!\n",
      "4074 Oh yeah.\n",
      "4075  Yeah?\n",
      "4076 Oh my God!\n",
      "4077 Oh, okay! \n",
      "4078 Hey!\n",
      "4079 Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!\n",
      "4080 So you uh, want to do something tonight?\n",
      "4081 Oh. Oh right! Right! Because youÂ’re still seeing him and uh, heÂ’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time whenÂ…",
      " \n",
      "4082 Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?\n",
      "4083 I bet he can.\n",
      "4084 Oh yeah! Yeah! DonÂ’t worry about me, IÂ’ll be fine! \n",
      "4085  Okay to come in?\n",
      "4086 Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?\n",
      "4087 IÂ’m the ruptured spleen. \n",
      "4088 Because you shouldnÂ’t be with him.  You should be with me.\n",
      "4089 Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they donÂ’t just happen. YÂ’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yÂ’know I was just lying there and I couldnÂ’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yÂ’know with a friend.\n",
      "4090 I know you probably donÂ’t want to go out with me, yÂ’know because I make too many jokes and IÂ’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess IÂ’m not technically a \"doctorÂ…",
      "\"\n",
      "4091 No, there were two.\n",
      "4092 Oh yeah.\n",
      "4093 Yeah.\n",
      "4094 Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.\n",
      "4095 I see where youÂ’re goinÂ’!\n",
      "4096  Ah, finally an explanation.\n",
      "4097 Hey-hey, is Monica here?\n",
      "4098 Okay, look I need your help, I donÂ’t know what to get her for ValentineÂ’s Day.\n",
      "4099  She was working on ValentineÂ’s Day so weÂ’re celebrating it tonight.\n",
      "4100 Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  I canÂ’t do that we promised weÂ’d make each other gifts this year.\n",
      "4101 Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.\n",
      "4102 I made aÂ…",
      " \n",
      "4103 Nothing!\n",
      "4104 Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?\n",
      "4105 \n",
      "4106 Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the ValentineÂ’s Day gifts?\n",
      "4107 Do we have to make the entire thing?\n",
      "4108 Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.\n",
      "4109  What?\n",
      "4110 Hey.\n",
      "4111 What?!\n",
      "4112 Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?\n",
      "4113 I canÂ’t figure out what to make Monica.\n",
      "4114 IÂ’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?\n",
      "4115 Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.\n",
      "4116 Wait a minute, I canÂ’t give this to her.\n",
      "4117 Because it says \"Captain Ross\" on the side and \"I hate Monica\" on the bottom.\n",
      "4118 Okay. Okay. \n",
      "4119 Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?\n",
      "4120 Okay, come here! Come here.\n",
      "4121 Now, itÂ’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.\n",
      "4122 But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.\n",
      "4123  Maybe weÂ’ll have to listen and see!\n",
      "4124 Okay!\n",
      "4125 Yeah!\n",
      "4126 ItÂ’s a sock bunny.\n",
      "4127 Not really.\n",
      "4128 I see. YÂ’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.\n",
      "4129 Oh, itÂ’s okay. I donÂ’t\n",
      "4130 \n",
      "4131 Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that!\n",
      "4132 You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.\n",
      "4133 Yeah! \n",
      "4134 You have done enough!\n",
      "4135 No you donÂ’tÂ—get it in black, not brown.\n",
      "4136 Oop!\n",
      "4137 Well, itÂ’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.\n",
      "4138 Who the hell is Carl?!\n",
      "4139 YÂ’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arenÂ’t they?\n",
      "4140 Oh my good God.\n",
      "4141 Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.\n",
      "4142 Oh, the mixed tape.\n",
      "4143 No! YouÂ’re the sweetest! \n",
      "4144 I am so, so, so, so sorry!\n",
      "4145 And I will cook anything you want in here \n",
      "4146 Come on Monica, itÂ’s our ValentineÂ’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?\n",
      "4147 Okay. \n",
      "4148 So, are we going in there?\n",

      "4150 A hot girlÂ’s at stake and all of the sudden heÂ’s Rain Man.\n",
      "4151 Oh, is that against the rules?\n",
      "4152 I see.\n",
      "4153 Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.\n",
      "4154 Oh, I donÂ’t know man. I havenÂ’t talked to her in like ten years.\n",
      "4155 You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred\n",
      "4156 Oh okay, IÂ’ll-IÂ’ll try.\n",
      "4157 Yeah so, Tuesday?\n",
      "4158  Thank you.\n",

      "4169 Honey, it is not a date! I havenÂ’t talked to her in ten years! You canÂ’t just call up somebody you havenÂ’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yÂ’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.\n",
      "4170 No, we only went out once.\n",
      "4171 Not once!\n",
      "4172  Oh thatÂ’s great, my friend JoeyÂ’s in the movie business.\n",

      "4231 Okay now it doesnÂ’t matter which one you choose, yÂ’know? ItÂ’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.\n",
      "4232  Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?\n",
      "4233 You know the hotels?\n",

      "4265 I messed up. Okay? IÂ’m sorry, I really messed up.\n",
      "4266 Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodyÂ’s allowed one mistake, right?\n",

      "4268 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]\n",

      "4274 Look, IÂ’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youÂ’re not perfect! YouÂ’ve made some errors in judgment too!\n",
      "4275  What happened?!!\n",

      "4297  Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!\n",
      "4298 YÂ’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!\n",
      "4299 Well thatÂ’s good. Because you didnÂ’t! And IÂ’m incredibly happy for ya!!\n",
      "4300 Oh, we could do this all day.\n",

      "4308 Are you judging them by their covers? Because youÂ’re really not supposed to do that.\n",
      "4309 Hey!\n",
      "4310 Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂ’re not ElizabethÂ’s dad?!\n",

      "4318 This is going in your book?\n",
      "4319 Hey!\n",
      "4320 Damn those robots, theyÂ’re supposed to be our faithful servants!\n",
      "4321 So do you think uh, JoeyÂ’s more charming than me?\n",

      "4326 Oh-oh.\n",
      "4327 We said seven!\n",
      "4328 The only way that I said six would be if the sevenÂ’s, let meet at seven, not at six.\n",
      "4329 Oh my good God.\n",
      "4330 What?!\n",
      "4331  What does it say?!\n",
      "4332 Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.\n",

      "4347 \n",
      "4348 \n",
      "4349 IÂ’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. \n",
      "4350 Right here! \n",
      "4351 Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!\n",
      "4352 Okay.\n",
      "4353 Yes, if it really doesnÂ’t mean anything, because you know that IÂ’m just not ready\n",
      "4354 Okay. \n",
      "4355 Totally.\n",
      "4356 Yeah, itÂ’s beautiful.\n",
      "4357 I know.\n",
      "4358 Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I canÂ’t figure this out! ItÂ’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aÂ—ah-ah! Paper cut!\n",
      "4359 No, I donÂ’t want to tell anybody else because I donÂ’t want Monica to find out.\n",
      "4360 Well, itÂ’s because I trust you, youÂ’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.\n",
      "4361 Me too.\n",
      "4362 Hey.\n",
      "4363 Oh all right.\n",
      "4364 Oh well, we donÂ’t because we gotÂ…",
      "theÂ…",
      "other pl-place.\n",
      "4365 Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weÂ’ve been too and I canÂ’t find the perfect ring! \n",
      "4366 YÂ’know, IÂ’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.\n",
      "4367 Yeah, IÂ’m gonna stick with the ring.  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?\n",
      "4368 Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.\n",
      "4369 Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youÂ…",
      "hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?\n",
      "4370  Oh my God thatÂ’s it, thatÂ’s the ring! How much is it?\n",
      "4371 Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.\n",
      "4372 Uh, credit card.  Okay, IÂ’ll go get it. You guard the ring.\n",
      "4373 No. How are ya Paul? \n",
      "4374 No, did he hug you?!\n",
      "4375 Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.\n",
      "4376 Yeah?\n",
      "4377 IÂ’m a little busy here Paul.\n",
      "4378 Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. \n",
      "4379 Okay! \n",
      "4380 Do you have my credit card?\n",
      "4381 Thank God! \n",
      "4382 Oh, I canÂ’t go.\n",
      "4383 Oh, thatÂ’s uh, thatÂ’s pretty nice but IÂ’m gonna go with the one I picked first.\n",
      "4384 What?\n",
      "4385 They put you in jail?\n",
      "4386 Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!\n",
      "4387 Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.\n",
      "4388 It was the ring!\n",
      "4389 I canÂ’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!\n",
      "4390 No, itÂ’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see MonicaÂ’s face when I gave it to her, yÂ’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing IÂ’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure itÂ’s perfect.\n",
      "4391 I canÂ’t do that.\n",
      "4392 Okay and he hasnÂ’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.\n",
      "4393 Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.\n",
      "4394  Ew.\n",
      "4395 No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You donÂ’t want to break her heart now do you?\n",
      "4396 Yeah, sheÂ’s dyingÂ…",
      " Of a cough apparently.\n",
      "4397  Okay, thatÂ’s enough honey!\n",
      "4398 Great! Okay, here. \n",
      "4399 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  Hey! IÂ’m marrying a dead woman!\n",
      "4400 Guys?  IÂ’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.\n",
      "4401 Yeah, check out the ring. \n",
      "4402 Yep, pretty much.\n",
      "4403  HeyyyyÂ—What?\n",
      "4404 Okay!  I was gonna wait Â‘til uh, it was official yÂ’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youÂ’re my best friends.\n",
      "4405 IÂ’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.\n",
      "4406 I know.\n",
      "4407 Check out the ring.\n",
      "4408 Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? \n",
      "4409 Okay, well tonightÂ’s the big night.\n",
      "4410 It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. IÂ’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast IÂ’m just gonna propose.\n",
      "4411 Yeah.\n",
      "4412 IÂ’m not gonna mess it up.\n",
      "4413 SheÂ’s not gonna say no.\n",
      "4414 Hey!\n",
      "4415  Give me it!\n",
      "4416 Phoebe!\n",
      "4417  Hi Monica.\n",
      "4418 Hey!\n",
      "4419  Well, Monica and Chandler canÂ’t go. WeÂ’re going to dinner remember?!\n",
      "4420 I just get mad when Rachel doesnÂ’t remember where weÂ’re going.\n",
      "4421 Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.\n",
      "4422 Oh, so youÂ’re already doing your part for the kids.\n",
      "4423 Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnÂ’t agree to that!\n",
      "4424 Will you marry me? Will you marry me?  WhatÂ’s going on little elves?\n",
      "4425 Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?\n",
      "4426 Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and sheÂ’s gonna know.\n",
      "4427  You are beautiful.\n",
      "4428 \n",
      "4429 Yes! Yes! IÂ’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everythingÂ—are youÂ—are you perrr-perfect?!\n",
      "4430 Oh, yeah.  Uh, no you canÂ’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you shouldÂ’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?\n",
      "4431 Yes! IÂ’m fine. In fact IÂ’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.\n",
      "4432 Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldnÂ’t imagine growing old with\n",
      "4433  I know, but just let me say it.\n",
      "4434 What?! IÂ’m Chandler!  Oh, thatÂ’s Richard!\n",
      "4435 Hey-hey, hey!  I donÂ’t know why I did that!\n",

      "4452 This is terrible. What am I going to do?\n",
      "4453 ThatÂ’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.\n",
      "4454 I can do that, IÂ’ve had 30 years of practice.\n",
      "4455 Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnÂ’t want to get married?\n",
      "4456 Hey!\n",

      "4458 Yeah, wellÂ…",
      " YÂ’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?\n",
      "4459 Eh\n",
      "4460 Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. LetÂ’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs donÂ’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thatÂ’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig thatÂ’s good at sports!\n",
      "4461 If marriage worked, IÂ’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.\n",

      "4463 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why donÂ’t you put down your copy of Â‘The RulesÂ’ huh mantrap?!\n",

      "4506 You okay over there?\n",
      "4507 Oh, donÂ’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.\n",
      "4508  Take whatever you want, just please donÂ’t hurt me.\n",
      "4509 Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.\n",
      "4510 Young! YouÂ’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyÂ’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!\n",
      "4511 Joe?\n",
      "4512 Uhh, youÂ’ve had a lot of sex right?\n",
      "4513 Well, itÂ’s just the reason that IÂ’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toÂ—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldnÂ’tÂ…",
      ". There huhÂ—hmm, there-there was an incident.\n",
      "4514 ItÂ’s happened to you?\n",
      "4515 Well, whatÂ’d you do?\n",
      "4516  I donÂ’t think thatÂ’s what they were talking about Joe!!\n",
      "4517 What?!\n",
      "4518 Yes, you can pass for 19.\n",
      "4519 Yes!\n",
      "4520 Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!\n",
      "4521 Now Monica, I know youÂ’re upset, but donÂ’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then thereÂ’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.\n",
      "4522 We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .\n",
      "4523 Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because itÂ’s romantic, but because I can!\n",
      "4524 Okay, donÂ’t say anything, you might scare it away.\n",
      "4525 ItÂ’s Paris, who knows weÂ’re here!\n",
      "4526 Pheebs, weÂ’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!\n",
      "4527 Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I donÂ’t care!\n",
      "4528 What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!\n",
      "4529  Ahh, third base.\n",
      "4530  Why to save your dignity my man.\n",
      "4531 Well, somebody should. \n",
      "4532 How is that ever going to happen?!\n",
      "4533  I donÂ’t care, she slept with me.\n",
      "4534 Thanks.\n",
      "4535  Hey! HereÂ’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.\n",
      "4536 Okay. \n",
      "4537 WhatÂ’s the matter honey?\n",
      "4538  Already?!\n",
      "4539 Oh, I got some thoughts on that.\n",
      "4540 What in GodÂ’s name is that?!\n",
      "4541 Well, you couldnÂ’t get them anyway. Ian doesnÂ’t plan anymore and DerrickÂ…",
      "  And Derrick is a name I shouldnÂ’t know.\n",
      "4542 Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?\n",
      "4543 Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?\n",
      "4544 Okay.\n",
      "4545 Centerpieces!\n",
      "4546 Definitely roses.  But Lilies are the clear choice.\n",
      "4547 Uh-huh!\n",
      "4548 Oh yeah, I should probably call them.\n",
      "4549 Oh, I donÂ’t think I ever heard that story.\n",
      "4550 What a sweet story.\n",
      "4551 Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. \n",
      "4552 I donÂ’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. SheÂ’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.\n",
      "4553 Honey, itÂ’s gonna be okay.\n",
      "4554 Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that weÂ’re gonna get married.\n",
      "4555 Well, I have some.\n",
      "4556 Well, close toÂ…",
      " \n",
      "4557 Well, youÂ’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?\n",
      "4558 Well, come on, IÂ’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.\n",
      "4559 No, I realize that honey, but IÂ’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.\n",
      "4560 Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.\n",
      "4561 Yes, I am!\n",
      "4562 Hey.\n",
      "4563 Ehh.\n",
      "4564 Look, I thought about it too, and IÂ’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\n",
      "4565 Yeah, IÂ’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatÂ’s what weÂ’re gonna do.\n",
      "4566 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yÂ’know? WeÂ’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\n",
      "4567 Yeah.\n",
      "4568 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\n",
      "4569 Well, stuff like whereÂ’d we live, yÂ’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. YÂ’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on itÂ’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, weÂ’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.\n",
      "4570 Sure you do.\n",
      "4571 You sure?\n",
      "4572 I love you so much.\n",
      "4573 Oh yeah, totally!\n",
      "4574 Hey, you guys!\n",
      "4575 So, what do you think?\n",
      "4576 Are you kidding? Okay, IÂ’ll give you a hint; IÂ’ll give you a hint. \n",
      "4577 I got glasses!\n",
      "4578 No I didnÂ’t!\n",
      "4579 No!\n",
      "4580 Really?\n",
      "4581  You didnÂ’t think I used to wear glasses, right?\n",
      "4582 ThatÂ’s okay Pheebs, weÂ’re not having a party or anything, so you donÂ’t have to get us\n",
      "4583 What we want honey.\n",
      "4584 Dying people say the craziest things.\n",
      "4585 Our kids are gonna be fat arenÂ’t they.\n",
      "4586 Hey! HowÂ’s the boat?!\n",
      "4587 Well, itÂ’s good that you finally have a place to do that.\n",
      "4588 Do you know what I was thinkinÂ’?\n",
      "4589 Nothing, I just like to go like this. \n",
      "4590 Uh why, do you have a lecture?\n",
      "4591 Then free as a bird. WhatÂ’s up?\n",
      "4592 Well, did-did you correct him?\n",
      "4593 Oh no problem, maybe IÂ’ll play with my left hand.\n",
      "4594 Does anybody know me?!\n",
      "4595 DonÂ’t worry about it Pheebs.\n",
      "4596 An old cookie?\n",
      "4597 We canÂ’t accept this.\n",
      "4598 Â‘Cause itÂ’s gross.\n",
      "4599 Okay, we owe you a present.\n",
      "4600 I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.\n",
      "4601 Daddy. All right look, hereÂ’s the story.  So I take off my glasses and thatÂ’s when in happened.\n",
      "4602 Guys?\n",
      "4603 I know.\n",
      "4604 Why do they put so much steam in there?!\n",
      "4605 Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?\n",
      "4606 Not that big a deal? ThereÂ…",
      "there was touching of things.\n",
      "4607 I donÂ’t want him to tell this story for years.\n",
      "4608 If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!\n",
      "4609  All right, IÂ’m off to see your dad.\n",
      "4610 Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceÂ—And by face I donÂ’t mean his lap. And by face, I donÂ’t mean my ass. \n",
      "4611 So you understand, IÂ’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didnÂ’t tell people what happened. YÂ’know, IÂ’m a littleÂ…",
      "IÂ’m a little embarrassed about it.\n",
      "4612 What did you do when they found out?\n",
      "4613 So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!\n",
      "4614 ItÂ’s your mommy. ItÂ’s your mommy.\n",
      "4615 That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.\n",
      "4616 And say nothing?\n",
      "4617 No-no-no-no. \n",
      "4618 Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?\n",
      "4619 Secret? Married people arenÂ’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.\n",
      "4620 No IÂ’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.\n",
      "4621 Oh no-no, I canÂ’t do that.\n",
      "4622 Okay.\n",
      "4623 So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, weÂ’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.\n",
      "4624 No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was PhoebeÂ’s secret?\n",
      "4625 ThatÂ’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?\n",
      "4626  Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!\n",
      "4627 What about him?\n",
      "4628 Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! DonÂ’t show this to Monica! And donÂ’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!\n",
      "4629 Hey.\n",
      "4630 Oh itÂ’s always nicer to here than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"\n",
      "4631 Hey.\n",
      "4632 Oh yeah?\n",
      "4633 Did you not understand the story?\n",
      "4634 Hey! WhatÂ’s up?\n",
      "4635 Huh.\n",
      "4636 No!  Shhh!\n",
      "4637 Nancy ThompsonÂ’s getting fired! \n",
      "4638 I had too okay?! WeÂ’re getting married! Married couples canÂ’t keep secrets from one another!\n",
      "4639 Du-ude!\n",
      "4640 Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"\n",
      "4641 In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.\n",
      "4642 Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?\n",
      "4643 You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!\n",
      "4644 Ross came in forth and cried!\n",
      "4645  WowÂ—whoa!\n",
      "4646 Hey!!!\n",
      "4647 That was you!\n",
      "4648  You have no trouble telling time now right?\n",
      "4649 Quick! What time is it?! \n",
      "4650 YÂ’know when I said that because weÂ’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?\n",
      "4651 Yeah that was stupid. LetÂ’s not do that.\n",
      "4652 Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnÂ’t hang out withÂ…",
      "all the guys in my office.\n",
      "4653 Hey.\n",
      "4654 Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!\n",
      "4655 What are you guys doing?\n",
      "4656 Oooh, IÂ’m afraid that does not exist.\n",
      "4657 No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whoÂ’s going like thisÂ…",
      " \n",
      "4658 I donÂ’t know what it is, I just canÂ’t take a good picture.\n",
      "4659 Yeah, IÂ’m not in that.\n",
      "4660 All right, but I should warn you, IÂ’m not going. IÂ’m going. \n",
      "4661 How about those three pointers?\n",
      "4662 And those guys were this  close to lettinÂ’ us play this time too.\n",
      "4663 Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.\n",
      "4664 They have that on the napkins at the club.\n",
      "4665 Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yÂ’know you canÂ’t date him right?\n",
      "4666 Dude that is so sad.\n",
      "4667 Could I play?\n",
      "4668 Okay. \n",
      "4669 No, I am.\n",
      "4670 I do? \n",
      "4671 Okay. \n",
      "4672 Aww! \n",
      "4673 Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?\n",
      "4674 I canÂ’t help it!\n",
      "4675 Borrow money from me?\n",
      "4676 Why is there jelly on your shoe?\n",
      "4677 Hey!\n",
      "4678  IÂ’m right here!\n",
      "4679 IÂ’m still right here!\n",
      "4680 Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?\n",
      "4681 Can you people not see me?! \n",
      "4682 There I am!\n",
      "4683 Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.\n",
      "4684 Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!\n",
      "4685 I donÂ’t know, but donÂ’t worry, donÂ’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now. \n",
      "4686 \n",
      "4687 Ahhh.\n",
      "4688 Oh yeah, that looks good.\n",
      "4689 Okay.\n",
      "4690 IÂ’m marrying her.\n",
      "4691 Die Hard still great!\n",
      "4692 WhatÂ’d you rent?\n",
      "4693  Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.\n",
      "4694 Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.\n",
      "4695 No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.\n",
      "4696 ThatÂ’s sweet.\n",
      "4697 So uh, what did this woman look like?\n",
      "4698 Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?\n",
      "4699 No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractiveÂ…",
      "  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.\n",
      "4700 Well, letÂ’s seeÂ…",
      " \n",
      "4701 Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.\n",
      "4702  No, weÂ’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.\n",
      "4703 Well, Â‘cause she came back the third summer and sheÂ’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow\n",
      "4704 I did not say fat! I said, \"Fa-aa-aw-owÂ…",
      "\"\n",
      "4705 Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?\n",
      "4706 Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.\n",
      "4707 Can you figure out what IÂ’m doing?\n",
      "4708 Who?\n",
      "4709 Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!\n",
      "4710 What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.\n",
      "4711 Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!\n",
      "4712  Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.\n",
      "4713  ItÂ’s a nickname, IÂ’ll explain later.\n",
      "4714 Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.\n",
      "4715 You-you-you didnÂ’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!\n",
      "4716 As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that IÂ’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.\n",
      "4717 I would really love it if could do both.\n",
      "4718 What?\n",
      "4719 What?!\n",
      "4720 A hundred and forty-five pounds.\n",
      "4721 Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!\n",
      "4722 Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.\n",
      "4723 You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!\n",
      "4724 Look you have to realize I donÂ’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youÂ’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.\n",
      "4725 So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.\n",
      "4726 IÂ’d carry you around in my pocket.\n",
      "4727 SkidmarkÂ’s still got a way with the ladies.\n",
      "4728 Come on! Why are we here?!\n",
      "4729 The hot chicks?\n",
      "4730 Wow thatÂ’s actually pretty cool.\n",
      "4731 Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.\n",
      "4732 You didnÂ’t bring me here to do that, did you?\n",
      "4733 OHÂ…",
      "MYÂ…",
      "GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnÂ’t tell her we were getting married, did you?\n",
      "4734 Did she freak out?\n",
      "4735 Right.\n",
      "4736  You said no right?\n",
      "4737 You said no right?!\n",
      "4738 Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkÂ’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canÂ’t wait to read your book Ross!!\n",
      "4739 What do you think sheÂ’s just gonna sit there quietly? You donÂ’t think sheÂ’s gonna want to make a toast? You donÂ’t think sheÂ’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!\n",
      "4740 YÂ’know what? ItÂ’s gonna be okay. YÂ’know what? SheÂ’s probably not gonna even want to come.\n",
      "4741 No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?\n",
      "4742 Yes!!\n",
      "4743 Yes!!!\n",
      "4744 Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itÂ’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! WeÂ’re not even sure why weÂ’re having it.\n",
      "4745 I say we go with Careless Whisper.\n",
      "4746  Did she see us yet? Did she see us?\n",
      "4747 ArenÂ’t you just a tinsy bit curious?\n",
      "4748 No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!\n",
      "4749 Is that what youÂ’re thinking about right now?\n",
      "4750 Janice, IÂ’m sorry but umm, you canÂ’t stay here tonight.\n",
      "4751 Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.\n",
      "4752 Say again?\n",
      "4753 Feelings, such strong feelings.\n",
      "4754 I just wanted to show Monica your book. \n",
      "4755 No, no, no. No-no-no.\n",
      "4756 No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.\n",
      "4757 Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .\n",
      "4758 Oh, okay, time's up!\n",
      "4759 Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?\n",
      "4760 Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inÂ…",
      "vegetables, Joey?\n",
      "4761 Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.\n",
      "4762 Oooh that may be a New World's record \n",
      "4763 Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. \n",
      "4764 I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!\n",
      "4765 Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.\n",
      "4766 Okay, but if you can'tÂ…",
      "no dinner!\n",
      "4767 Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.\n",
      "4768 I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.\n",
      "4769 Which smells delicious!\n",
      "4770 What?\n",
      "4771 Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!\n",
      "4772 Huh! Where is the dog?!\n",
      "4773 Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!\n",
      "4774 What is it doing here?\n",
      "4775 Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!\n",
      "4776  Really?\n",
      "4777 Well, it still has to go, right?\n",
      "4778 Okay, it's um\n",
      "4779  Okay, I hate dogs.\n",
      "4780 They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.\n",
      "4781  Is there a puppy here?\n",
      "4782  Okay, you are new!\n",
      "4783 Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "4784 And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!!\n",
      "4785  Here I am.\n",
      "4786 How did youÂ…",
      "know? \n",
      "4787  Where's Monica?\n",
      "4788 Why not?\n",
      "4789 Well, I, I should go in there.\n",
      "4790 Why not?\n",
      "4791 This is ridiculous. \n",
      "4792 Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.\n",
      "4793 Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?\n",
      "4794 And that doesn't scare you? \n",
      "4795 No, no he went for a walk.\n",
      "4796 Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.\n",
      "4797 Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. YÂ’know, for you, andÂ…",
      "\n",
      "4798 Clunkers?! Oh my god!\n",
      "4799  It is so good to see you!\n",
      "4800 It's up to you.\n",
      "4801 All right.\n",
      "4802 You got it.  You got Nevada twice.\n",
      "4803 Yeah. \n",
      "4804 Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. \n",
      "4805 Okay. Okay.\n",
      "4806 That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.\n",
      "4807 Hey! What are you guys doing?\n",
      "4808 IÂ’m sorry, who?\n",
      "4809 But we donÂ’t know the neighbors.\n",
      "4810 WouldnÂ’t it be easier if we just moved?\n",
      "4811 Eh, somebodyÂ’s in a good mood!\n",
      "4812 Well, either that or uhÂ…",
      "\n",
      "4813  Am not!\n",
      "4814 DonÂ’t worry, IÂ’m brave! I am brave! IÂ…",
      "I am brave!  Can you tell me who is there please?\n",
      "4815  4:00 A.M.\n",
      "4816 I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!  He does not know that I am not some of us.\n",
      "4817 Mm! Night GarÂ’! \n",
      "4818 Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!\n",
      "4819 Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?\n",
      "4820  What happened? IÂ’m just eating candy.\n",
      "4821 Absolutely! YÂ’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.\n",
      "4822 What is the matter with you?\n",
      "4823 Maybe, isnÂ’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?\n",
      "4824 YÂ’know what would work?\n",
      "4825 Stop making candy!\n",
      "4826 You mean they like you.\n",
      "4827 Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?\n",
      "4828  What is going on?\n",
      "4829 Joey!\n",
      "4830 What are you doing?\n",
      "4831 Get in here!  Merry Christmas.\n",
      "4832 All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and IÂ’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?\n",
      "4833 No not  Candy Lady.\n",
      "4834 All right, yÂ’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! YouÂ’ve ruined it! Go home! YouÂ’ve ruined it! YouÂ’ve ruined it!\n",
      "4835 YouÂ’re welcome. \n",
      "4836 No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uhÂ—are you okay?\n",
      "4837 Buh-bye.  I just got us reservations at MichelleÂ’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.\n",
      "4838 betrothed couple.\n",
      "4839 Hey!\n",
      "4840 Pheebs?\n",
      "4841 Skull?\n",
      "4842 How long have we been home?\n",
      "4843 Lovely!\n",
      "4844 Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?\n",
      "4845 Why not?\n",
      "4846 Hey!\n",
      "4847 Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?\n",
      "4848 Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.\n",
      "4849 No reason, exceptÂ…",
      "sheÂ…",
      "toldÂ…",
      "me.\n",
      "4850 No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.\n",
      "4851 Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?\n",
      "4852 \n",
      "4853 Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.\n",
      "4854 Is this because of the burrito thing?\n",
      "4855 Give him money? It was a joke!\n",
      "4856 Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.\n",
      "4857 Hey, I can be smooth. \n",
      "4858 Okay. \n",
      "4859 Had the money in the wrong hand. \n",
      "4860 How do you know so much about this?\n",
      "4861 Richard used to do it, didn't he?\n",
      "4862 Mustached bastard\n",
      "4863  Excuse me...\n",
      "4864 \n",
      "4865 Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Thank you.\n",
      "4866 Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "4867 If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?\n",
      "4868  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\n",
      "4869 Hey! \n",
      "4870 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdÂ…",
      "turtle-man?\n",
      "4871 What?\n",
      "4872 You bet I did, Ben, put it there!  Ho, ho, ho!\n",
      "4873 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\n",
      "4874 Why?\n",
      "4875 But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\n",
      "4876 Fine, I'll give the suit back.\n",
      "4877 Santa? Really?\n",
      "4878 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\n",
      "4879 Then it's okay! \n",
      "4880 Because, if Santa and the HolidayÂ…",
      "Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!\n",
      "4881 Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?\n",
      "4882 My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. \n",
      "4883 Ohh. Mmm.\n",
      "4884 Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.\n",
      "4885  It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.\n",
      "4886 IÂ—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.\n",
      "4887 Because it's too delicious.\n",
      "4888 No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  I feel terrible, IÂ’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.\n",
      "4889 So\n",
      "4890 Oh, whatÂ’s at 8:00?\n",
      "4891 Well, maybe since the age of 9, FrannieÂ’s made some new friends.\n",
      "4892 I used to undress my cousin Glenn. \n",
      "4893 Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!\n",
      "4894 I canÂ’t seem to say goodbye.\n",
      "4895 Well IÂ’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!\n",
      "4896  YÂ’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.\n",
      "4897 Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?\n",
      "4898 Well, thank you for lunch.\n",
      "4899 So apparently we just donÂ’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?\n",
      "4900 Mrs. Braverman must be out. \n",
      "4901 By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We donÂ’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.\n",
      "4902 Well, we donÂ’t want that.\n",
      "4903 But we should take it.\n",
      "4904 Why?\n",
      "4905 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! \n",
      "4906 IÂ’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, IÂ’ll regret it.\n",
      "4907 What are you doing tonight?\n",
      "4908 Dude! Dude! \n",
      "4909 Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.\n",
      "4910 ThatÂ’s what Monica said.\n",
      "4911 Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!\n",
      "4912 I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!\n",
      "4913 YÂ’know what? I donÂ’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and IÂ’m takinÂ’ it back! \n",
      "4914 Oh yes!\n",
      "4915 Oh yes!\n",
      "4916 Oh yes! Oh yes!\n",
      "4917 Well thatÂ’s not fair, youÂ’ve already had some!\n",
      "4918 What do we use to split it?\n",
      "4919  Okay well, this side looks bigger. UhÂ…",
      " ThereÂ’s more crust on this side. YÂ’know? So, maybe if I measured\n",
      "4920 All right, IÂ’ll pick that one. \n",
      "4921  Ohhh!\n",
      "4922 Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and donÂ’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat myÂ…",
      " \n",
      "4923 Stick to your side!\n",
      "4924  ThatÂ’s a plane!\n",
      "4925  No, IÂ’m not!\n",
      "4926 Because itÂ’s flattering! \n",
      "4927  Monica!\n",
      "4928 I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?\n",
      "4929 Sorry, I justÂ…",
      "canÂ’t sleep. Ooh! \n",
      "4930 What?! \n",
      "4931 Shhhhhhhhh!!!  IÂ’m sorry, I thought maybe IÂ’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.\n",
      "4932 It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!\n",
      "4933 Hey, yÂ’know what we can do? YÂ’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yÂ’know like we did when we were first going out. ItÂ’d be fun!\n",
      "4934 Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?\n",
      "4935  No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.\n",
      "4936 ThatÂ’s correct.\n",
      "4937  What? What? What?\n",
      "4938 Yeah! You?\n",
      "4939  I hope youÂ’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.\n",
      "4940 Do you know what just happened?\n",
      "4941 No. We were in the middle of sexÂ…",
      "and you fell asleep.\n",
      "4942  Monica?\n",
      "4943 I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!\n",
      "4944 Okay.\n",
      "4945 Yeah!  And I probably wonÂ’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.\n",
      "4946 Hm-hmm, I told you!  I canÂ’t believe that IÂ’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.\n",
      "4947 Well, youÂ’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes\n",
      "4948 Do you wanna?\n",
      "4949 CouldnÂ’t I just say, \"This is Ross?\"\n",
      "4950 \n",
      "4951 Joey! Joe! \n",
      "4952 My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! \n",
      "4953 Hey!\n",
      "4954 Yeah, IÂ’d love to but IÂ’ve tried that so many times they wonÂ’t even let me in the store anymore.\n",
      "4955  Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?\n",
      "4956 ThatÂ’s awesome! ThatÂ’s great! What made you do it?!\n",
      "4957 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke JoeyÂ’s chair?\n",
      "4958 I thought I broke JoeyÂ’s chair! ThatÂ’s why I replaced it with mine!\n",
      "4959 Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?\n",
      "4960 IÂ’m gettinÂ’ my chair back! \n",
      "4961 Joey you broke my chair!!\n",
      "4962 I think I should get the chair!\n",
      "4963 Because you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnÂ’t broke a chair, is me!\n",
      "4964 Well, whereÂ’s the logic in that?!\n",
      "4965 So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!\n",
      "4966 What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!\n",
      "4967  SheÂ’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.\n",
      "4968 No Rach, itÂ’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnÂ’t that much fun.\n",
      "4969 Ross, a sports car? WouldnÂ’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?\n",
      "4970  Would you put that back on?! MonicaÂ’s gonna be here any minute!\n",
      "4971  Okay, for the last time. ItÂ’s not named for each individual man.\n",
      "4972 Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I canÂ’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! \n",
      "4973 Ohh! \n",
      "4974 Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! \n",
      "4975  Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out whatÂ’s going on.\n",
      "4976 Hey-hey are you drunk?\n",
      "4977 Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!\n",
      "4978 Yes!\n",
      "4979 Yes!!\n",
      "4980 Okay, hereÂ’s the thing. WeÂ’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youÂ’re drunk.\n",
      "4981 Yeah, IÂ’ll take care of it.\n",
      "4982  Okay we have to do something about your breath.\n",
      "4983 ThatÂ’s still yours. Okay, now remember itÂ’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.\n",
      "4984 Okay.\n",
      "4985 Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.\n",
      "4986 See? \n",
      "4987  Phil.\n",
      "4988 Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  youÂ’re doing great. YouÂ’re doing great. YouÂ’re doing fine.\n",
      "4989 MonicaÂ’s a little drunk.\n",
      "4990  She doesnÂ’t want her parents to know sheÂ’s drunk.\n",
      "4991 MonicaÂ’s wasted.\n",
      "4992  Okay, will you just go help her change please!\n",
      "4993 Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!\n",
      "4994 For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!\n",
      "4995 No-no-no-no! That was the joke!\n",
      "4996 No, because youÂ’re not a grandmother!\n",
      "4997  There we go.\n",
      "4998  How are you feeling?\n",
      "4999  Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and donÂ’t talk to anyone.\n",
      "5000 Pheebs!!\n",
      "5001 I think itÂ’s necessary. \n",
      "5002 What?\n",
      "5003 Okay, here we go.\n",
      "5004 Hey! HowÂ’d it go?\n",
      "5005 Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.\n",
      "5006  Monica said wedding.\n",
      "5007 Do you think you could get through a poem?\n",
      "5008 Too?\n",
      "5009 Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. \n",
      "5010 ThatÂ’s great!\n",
      "5011 So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!\n",
      "5012 DonÂ’t do it.\n",
      "5013 I think itÂ’s the dying cat parade.\n",
      "5014  Oh my God!\n",
      "5015 YÂ’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, \"YouÂ’re half Scottish right?\"\n",
      "5016 Yes!!\n",
      "5017 Why is your family Ross?!\n",
      "5018 If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.\n",
      "5019 Well, I feel like a snack!\n",
      "5020 Oh no thanks. I donÂ’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.\n",
      "5021 Well itÂ’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland byÂ…",
      "Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. \n",
      "5022 We heard you play all the way from your apartment!\n",
      "5023 ThatÂ’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just donÂ’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.\n",
      "5024 Because we hate them.\n",
      "5025 We have heard you play.\n",
      "5026 You mean the spitter?\n",
      "5027 Easy for you to say; youÂ’ll be wearing a veil.\n",
      "5028 You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?\n",
      "5029 Sorry, I just donÂ’t like the idea of when I say, \"I do,\" heÂ’s thinking, \"Yeah, IÂ’d do her too!\"\n",
      "5030 Yeah!\n",
      "5031 Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.\n",
      "5032 We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!\n",
      "5033 No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.\n",
      "5034 Joe\n",
      "5035  YÂ’know, we havenÂ’t found anybody else.\n",
      "5036 Yeah you can do it.\n",
      "5037 Yeah.\n",
      "5038 Hey!\n",
      "5039 Hey!\n",
      "5040 Our minister\n",
      "5041 Okay.\n",
      "5042  Should we call the spitter?\n",
      "5043 Yeah. O-okay.\n",
      "5044 See Joe, not that thatÂ’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! YÂ’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!\n",
      "5045 No, not usÂ…",
      " \n",
      "5046 See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yÂ’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.\n",
      "5047 Joe?\n",
      "5048 IsnÂ’t that what happened with you and the brideÂ’s maid?\n",
      "5049 And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.\n",
      "5050 But then later that night\n",
      "5051  Hey!\n",
      "5052 Well I wasÂ…",
      " I was exactly expecting company afterÂ…",
      " 9:15.\n",
      "5053 Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brideÂ’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youÂ’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?\n",
      "5054 Well, look itÂ’s been a really emotional time yÂ’know, and youÂ’ve had a lot to drink. And youÂ’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!\n",
      "5055 You kidding? YouÂ’re the most beautiful woman in most roomsÂ…",
      "  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! WhatÂ’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\n",
      "5056 But we donÂ’t do that.\n",
      "5057 How drunk are you?\n",
      "5058  ThatÂ’s the perfect amount!\n",
      "5059 What?\n",
      "5060 I know.\n",
      "5061 Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?\n",
      "5062 Okay!\n",
      "5063 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\n",
      "5064 Yep!\n",
      "5065 Count of three?\n",
      "5066 Two!\n",
      "5067 Well I think itÂ’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\n",
      "5068 Eh!\n",

      "5093 Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!\n",
      "5094 Gap commercial.  So did you book them? Did you call?\n",

      "5129 What?\n",
      "5130 No. No, see when I first meet somebody itÂ’s uh itÂ’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.\n",
      "5131 Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and IÂ’m afraid even more sweating.\n",
      "5132 I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.\n",

      "a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours\n",
      "5138 Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!\n",

      "5141  Hi! Nice to meet you!\n",
      "5142 IÂ’ll be right with you.\n",
      "5143 I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. ItÂ’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.\n",
      "5144 Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?\n",
      "5145 This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.\n",
      "5146 YÂ’know I think we should invite them.\n",
      "5147 Well this is just sad!\n",
      "5148 Well, thanks a lot for hookinÂ’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.\n",
      "5149  Well, whatÂ’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.\n",

      "5158 Oh, I have to get married in James BondÂ’s tux!\n",
      "5159 Oh, itÂ’s not just that, I would be EnglandÂ’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestyÂ’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?\n",
      "5160 A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?\n",
      "5161 What?\n",
      "5162 You canÂ’t wear that! IÂ’m wearing the famous tux! James BondÂ’s tux!\n",
      "5163 SoÂ—If you wear that youÂ’ll make mine less special.\n",
      "5164 Please, donÂ’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!\n",
      "5165 Look, itÂ’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.\n",
      "5166 That was pretty 007.\n",
      "5167 Ross is Batman!\n",
      "5168 Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!\n",

      "5170 Batman has the Batmobile!\n",
      "5171 Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right?\n",
      "5172 Actually, I donÂ’t like martinis.\n",
      "5173 Ooh, yum! \n",
      "5174 I would but mine doesnÂ’t fit. The pants are a little tight.\n",
      "5175 Well, does that mean that youÂ’re not going to wearing yours?\n",
      "5176  Let me try it on!\n",
      "5177  WhatÂ’s this?\n",
      "5178 An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnÂ’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!\n",
      "5179 The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. \n",
      "5180 Well, youÂ’re welcome. And tell them weÂ’re really glad theyÂ’re coming.\n",
      "5181  All right! I found one that fits!\n",
      "5182 Whose is it?\n",
      "5183 Whose is it?\n",
      "5184 Oh, come on! I donÂ’t care! Come on! Whose is it?\n",
      "5185 Do you realize you get louder each week?\n",
      "5186 I figured IÂ’d buy those. Pat, IÂ’d like to buy a vow. \n",
      "5187 Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?\n",
      "5188 Do you happen to know what IÂ’m going to say?\n",
      "5189  Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! WhatÂ’s wrong with me? Ooh, donÂ’t open that door.\n",
      "5190  There are no words! This should not be this hard!\n",
      "5191 IÂ’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldÂ’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!\n",
      "5192 Yeah, IÂ’m not sure I can do that.\n",
      "5193  Okay.\n",
      "5194 All right, thereÂ’s a nuclear holocaust, IÂ’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?\n",
      "5195  ThatÂ’s one?\n",
      "5196 Oh, yÂ’know-yÂ’know what, I was looking at it upside down.\n",
      "5197  Monica\n",
      "5198  Yeah?\n",
      "5199 You'll get one.\n",
      "5200 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\n",
      "5201 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\n",
      "5202 No, no, no.\n",
      "5203  Uh, uh.\n",
      "5204 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! \n",
      "5205 Nice try.\n",
      "5206 Look, Monica\n",
      "5207 This is not going to work.\n",
      "5208 You are so great! I love you!\n",
      "5209 Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!\n",
      "5210 No I didn't!\n",
      "5211 No I didn't!\n",
      "5212 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\n",
      "5213 YÂ’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\n",
      "5214 Well, what if all my stuff was here?\n",
      "5215 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂ’m saying?\n",
      "5216 Oh my God.\n",
      "5217 Okay!  Monica, will you marry me?\n",
      "5218 I've had a very long, hard day.\n",
      "5219 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.\n",
      "5220 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.\n",
      "5221 Hey Joe!\n",
      "5222 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a CokeÂ—Â—Diet Coke.\n",
      "5223 It happened in London.\n",
      "5224 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "5225 No-no-no-no-no! You can't!\n",
      "5226 \n",
      "5227  Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!\n",
      "5228 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?\n",
      "5229 Phoebe knows about us!\n",
      "5230 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!\n",
      "5231 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!\n",
      "5232 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! \n",
      "5233 Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?\n",
      "5234 Oh, you're-you're going?\n",
      "5235  It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.\n",
      "5236 Not if I kiss you first.\n",
      "5237 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\n",
      "5238 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\n",
      "5239 Because I'm in love with Monica!!\n",
      "5240 Love her! That's right, IÂ…",
      "LOVEÂ…",
      "HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.\n",
      "5241 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n",
      "5242 Who are those people?\n",
      "5243 WhatÂ’s going on?\n",
      "5244 So we both finished our vows.\n",
      "5245 DonÂ’t worry honey, weÂ’ll make yours funnier.\n",
      "5246 Okay, what do you guys think?\n",
      "5247 You really like it?\n",
      "5248 I stole MonicaÂ’s and changed the name.\n",
      "5249 Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thatÂ’s because I didnÂ’t send him an invitation.\n",
      "5250 I donÂ’t even know the man. Okay? WeÂ’re not the close. I havenÂ’t seen him in years.\n",
      "5251 Well he doesnÂ’t have to know! ItÂ’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.\n",
      "5252 Trust me, you donÂ’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.\n",
      "5253 WhatÂ’s this?\n",
      "5254 Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersÂ—Think of the money weÂ’ll save!!  WeÂ’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?\n",
      "5255 YÂ’know we already went over this and I won!\n",
      "5256 Look forget it okay? I donÂ’t want to go. I donÂ’t want to see him. I donÂ’t wanna.\n",
      "5257 No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youÂ’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. YÂ’know itÂ’s hard enough to be fourteen. YouÂ’re skinny. YouÂ’re wearing speedoesÂ—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and thereÂ’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!\n",
      "5258 He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!\n",
      "5259 Does it matter?!\n",
      "5260 Yeah o-okay, but IÂ’m just doing this for you.\n",
      "5261 So I really never get to win anymore?\n",
      "5262 Yeah, I just ordered a beer! \n",
      "5263 No! No! I donÂ’t want him to know weÂ’re yet! IÂ’m not sure IÂ’m ready for that. And besides heÂ’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.\n",
      "5264 I donÂ’t know if IÂ’ve told you this, but heÂ’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years\n",
      "5265 Yeah, heÂ’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. YÂ’know itÂ’s all very Cats in the CradleÂ—I donÂ’t want to get into it.  Here we go.\n",
      "5266 And thereÂ’s daddy!\n",
      "5267 Believe me, IÂ’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!\n",
      "5268 ThatÂ’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.\n",
      "5269 HeÂ’s coming into the audience. HeÂ’s coming into the audience.\n",
      "5270 It canÂ’t happen like this. Okay? IÂ’ll meet you back at the hotel.\n",
      "5271 \n",
      "5272 Oh, theyÂ’re a hoot.\n",
      "5273 Actually Monica and I are engaged.\n",
      "5274 Wait! Wait! WeÂ’d really love it if you could be there.\n",
      "5275 I know it would make me happy, maÂ’am.\n",
      "5276 Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.\n",
      "5277  When I was growing up IÂ…",
      "played the one on the far left.\n",
      "5278 Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.\n",
      "5279 The young hot ball and chain.\n",
      "5280 WhatÂ’s up?\n",
      "5281 Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. IÂ’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.\n",
      "5282 But youÂ’re still my friend?\n",
      "5283 During this timeÂ…",
      "are you, are you still my best man?\n",
      "5284 Do I still call you Ross?\n",
      "5285  Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.\n",
      "5286 So are weÂ…",
      "friends again?\n",
      "5287 Okay.  You wonÂ’t believe what MonicaÂ’s older brother just said to me!\n",
      "5288  Okay. HereÂ’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.\n",
      "5289 Yes, include more people in this.\n",
      "5290 Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.\n",
      "5291 Well you donÂ’t have to sound so surprised.\n",
      "5292 What?\n",
      "5293 Honestly? Me too.\n",
      "5294 Yeah. YÂ’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and IÂ’ll go allÂ…",
      "Chandler. But nothing has.\n",
      "5295 Okay. IÂ’ll be right there.\n",
      "5296 WeÂ’re the Bings.\n",
      "5297 Mr. and Mrs. Bing! \n",
      "5298 Hi.\n",
      "5299 Mom. Thanks for wearing something. \n",
      "5300 HiÂ…",
      "dad.\n",
      "5301 Oh my God! \n",
      "5302 How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldÂ’ve hid at the gym!\n",
      "5303 Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that IÂ’m related to Monica. How is she?\n",
      "5304 No! No! No! I canÂ’t do that!\n",
      "5305 Because if I go home, weÂ’re gonna become the Bings! I canÂ’t be the Bings!\n",
      "5306 The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!\n",
      "5307 No.\n",
      "5308 ItÂ’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodyÂ’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And IÂ’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I donÂ’t race cars! I donÂ’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.\n",
      "5309 I want to. I love her so much, but IÂ’m afrÂ…",
      "ItÂ’s too huge.\n",
      "5310 Well yeah, but then\n",
      "5311 Depends on what you mean by we.\n",
      "5312 No.\n",
      "5313 Yeah okay. Well, whatÂ’s the next little bit?\n",
      "5314 Yeah. YouÂ’re right. Hey I-I can do that.\n",
      "5315 Okay, excuse me for a minute. \n",
      "5316 Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.\n",
      "5317 Okay.\n",
      "5318 Oh fresh air!\n",
      "5319 What?\n",
      "5320 Ross! \n",
      "5321  ThatÂ’s right! IÂ’m not!\n",
      "5322 I know about Monica.\n",
      "5323 Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.\n",
      "5324 You donÂ’t know?\n",
      "5325 MonicaÂ’s pregnant.\n",
      "5326 Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes\n",
      "5327 Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and thatÂ’s when I uh, saw this.  Yeah, yÂ’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, canÂ’t be scary.\n",
      "5328 But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so sheÂ’d know I was okay.\n",
      "5329 You look beautiful mom. \n",
      "5330 Are you Joey?\n",
      "5331 You look beautiful. Is this new? \n",
      "5332 Okay.\n",
      "5333  HeÂ’s Greek Orthodox.\n",
      "5334 \n",
      "5335 I do.\n",
      "5336  I love you. And I know about the baby.\n",
      "5337 Our baby.\n",
      "5338 Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.\n",
      "5339 ThenÂ…",
      "who did?\n",
      "5340 Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. \n",
      "5341 Hey Rach! \n",
      "5342 What the fuÂ—Â—ck are you doing?!\n",
      "5343 What are you guys doing?\n",
      "5344 You see, I donÂ’t sayÂ—\n",
      "5345  Whoa! SheÂ’s purty!\n",
      "5346 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!\n",
      "5347 MonicaÂ’s gotta have the phone in the right place andÂ—\n",
      "5348 What?! What are you talking about?\n",
      "5349 WhoÂ’s the father?\n",
      "5350 Why not?\n",
      "5351 As in Barbara StreisandÂ’s husband James Brolin?\n",
      "5352 YÂ’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.\n",
      "5353 Before we go out there IÂ’ve got a present for ya.\n",
      "5354 No?\n",
      "5355 IÂ’ve been taking dancing lessons.\n",
      "5356 Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.\n",
      "5357 So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?\n",
      "5358 I donÂ’t know, itÂ’s these new shoes, theyÂ’re all slippery.\n",
      "5359 Not well.\n",
      "5360 Thank you.\n",
      "5361 Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.\n",
      "5362 Funny: ha-ha or funny: \n",
      "5363 What size shoes do you wear?\n",
      "5364 Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?\n",
      "5365  Those arenÂ’t eleven and a half.\n",
      "5366 And the world will never know.\n",
      "5367 Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.\n",
      "5368 But youÂ’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.\n",
      "5369 Did it turn into sand?\n",
      "5370  No. No, I wonÂ’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnÂ’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.\n",
      "5371 Why?\n",
      "5372  Hi! WeÂ’re checking out of the bridal suite.\n",
      "5373 And IÂ’m the happiest guy in the world!  Oh honey, come on donÂ’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!\n",
      "5374 We got the honeymoon.\n",
      "5375 The wedding pictures?\n",
      "5376 Not the disposable cameras from the tables.\n",
      "5377 IÂ’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.\n",
      "5378 What? What did you take a picture of?\n",
      "5379 Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?\n",
      "5380 Oh.\n",
      "5381 Okay, well IÂ’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. \n",
      "5382 Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?\n",
      "5383 Yeah but you donÂ’t needÂ—Â—What is this?\n",
      "5384 Score! Where are the disposable cameras?\n",
      "5385 The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?\n",
      "5386 Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said\n",
      "5387 So you donÂ’t have the cameras?!\n",
      "5388 So? What? What? TheyÂ’re gone! MonicaÂ’s gonna freak!\n",
      "5389 Great.\n",
      "5390 Hey! Did you find the cameras?\n",
      "5391 Yes! And thatÂ’s why IÂ’m under the table. Celebrating.\n",
      "5392 Well this is great. YÂ’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheÂ’s really depressed.\n",
      "5393 All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canÂ’t believe I screwed this up!\n",
      "5394 Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?\n",
      "5395 Are you serious?\n",
      "5396 Marriage advice? Really?!\n",
      "5397 I donÂ’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.\n",
      "5398 She picked those out too.\n",
      "5399 That was her.\n",
      "5400 I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?\n",
      "5401  Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?\n",
      "5402 UhhÂ…",
      " Yeah sure.  Click!\n",
      "5403 Oh yeah. IÂ’ll take, IÂ’ll take your picture. \n",
      "5404 Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!\n",
      "5405 Why donÂ’t you go up on stage. IÂ’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.\n",
      "5406 Okay, you ready for the last picture?\n",
      "5407 Get ready to run. \n",
      "5408 WeÂ’re back!\n",
      "5409 ItÂ’s picture time.\n",
      "5410  Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.\n",
      "5411 Eh?\n",
      "5412 Okay, so this isnÂ’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withÂ…",
      "with this lady. Which by the look on your face IÂ’m sure youÂ’ll remember. So we donÂ’t needÂ—Â—ThereÂ’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.\n",
      "5413 Okay.  You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!\n",
      "5414 Call it even?!\n",
      "5415 Hey! Babe! ArenÂ’t you excited weÂ’re going on our honeymoon?\n",
      "5416  Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama\n",
      "5417 IÂ’d better go pack.\n",
      "5418 A Speedo? Uh, I donÂ’t have a Speedo. IÂ’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. \n",
      "5419  Hey, what was that all about?\n",
      "5420  Why am I talking like this?!\n",
      "5421  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.\n",
      "5422 Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.\n",
      "5423 You already know.\n",
      "5424 Oh honey, leave them alone, theyÂ’re in love.\n",
      "5425 We are on our honeymoon.\n",
      "5426 25J and K, any chance those arenÂ’t together?\n",
      "5427 No.\n",
      "5428 Just act like you belong.\n",
      "5429 Shh! \n",
      "5430 Yes, of course. \n",
      "5431 Oh thatÂ’s all right, I have it memorized. ItÂ’s 1A.\n",
      "5432 Apology accepted. Excuse us. \n",
      "5433 Oh youÂ’ve got to be kidding me.\n",
      "5434 WeÂ’re you just ten seconds later!\n",
      "5435  We need the stuff.\n",
      "5436 What else is new?\n",
      "5437 Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I canÂ’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.\n",
      "5438 TheyÂ’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.\n",
      "5439 IÂ’m sorry, weÂ’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.\n",
      "5440 Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance\n",
      "5441 We reallyÂ…",
      "didnÂ’t get a chance to\n",
      "5442 Ross! ItÂ’s got your wavy black lines!\n",
      "5443 YÂ’know who has a great video camera?\n",
      "5444 LetÂ’s call Â‘em.\n",
      "5445 Here you go. \n",
      "5446 What?\n",
      "5447 I donÂ’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.\n",
      "5448 Yeah, weÂ’re gonna need to see that tape. \n",
      "5449 I still donÂ’t get it, we didnÂ’t do anything wrong.\n",
      "5450 I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!\n",
      "5451 Well maybe it was all of your questions.\n",
      "5452 The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!\n",
      "5453  Was that another question?\n",
      "5454 Did you do it on our invitations?!\n",
      "5455 So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! \n",
      "5456 ThatÂ’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!\n",
      "5457 Jenny! That is so Jenny!\n",
      "5458 You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?\n",
      "5459 WhatÂ’s funny about that?\n",
      "5460 Hey thatÂ’s okay. So, where do you want to go?\n",
      "5461 The Hard Rock Caf?\n",
      "5462 Again?!\n",
      "5463 You like the Purple Rain display!  Hey Bob.\n",
      "5464 Yeah, he thinks thatÂ’s my name.\n",
      "5465 Oh itÂ’s been going on way to long now. YÂ’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnÂ’t say anything. And then the next time he said, \"Hey Toby, do you want a donut?\" And I-I wanted a donut. And now itÂ’s five years later, the donutÂ’s gone and IÂ’m still Toby.\n",
      "5466 No! That would be so awkward! LookÂ—Besides, we work in different departments. HeÂ’s on the sixth floor yÂ’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. WhatÂ’s the big deal? It could be worse, itÂ’s not like heÂ’s calling me Muriel. \n",

      "5487 No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!\n",
      "5488 How is that me?\n",
      "5489 When have I ever done that?!\n",

      "5496 Oh relax man, relax. YouÂ’re looking a little flushed.\n",
      "5497 What question?\n",
      "5498 ThereÂ’s no question.\n",
      "5499  You picked Ross?!\n",
      "5500 I cannot believe you didnÂ’t pick me.\n",
      "5501 Oh really?! You think youÂ’re stronger? Why donÂ’t you prove it? \n",
      "5502  YouÂ’re going down.\n",
      "5503 That means nothing to me.  Come on!\n",
      "5504 And dignity.\n",
      "5505 Nope! I can do this all day.\n",
      "5506 God, IÂ’m exhausted.\n",
      "5507 No way! If anything youÂ’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks IÂ’m a wimp!\n",
      "5508 YouÂ’re Spudnik.\n",
      "5509 Fine.  Oh no!\n",
      "5510 Listen, IÂ’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.\n",
      "5511 No, I let him winÂ—Ross!\n",
      "5512 Would you tell her I let you win please?\n",
      "5513 I am strong! IÂ’ll show you! \n",
      "5514 Oh whatÂ’s the matter? Are you scared?\n",
      "5515 Okay. 1Â…",

      "3Â—Go!  IÂ’m gonna kill myself!\n",
      "5516 Hey.\n",
      "5517 YÂ’know uh, I didnÂ’t actually do this.\n",
      "5518 No, it wasnÂ’t you.\n",
      "5519 I got a maid. Yay!\n",
      "5520 Uh honey, I know you donÂ’t like to relinquish control\n",
      "5521 Look, sheÂ’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.\n",
      "5522 Yes, I distinctly remember Â‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?\n",
      "5523 WhatÂ’s the matter?\n",
      "5524 See? I told you.\n",
      "5525  What?\n",
      "5526 So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?\n",
      "5527 She mustÂ’ve been planning this for years!\n",
      "5528 Honey, isnÂ’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?\n",
      "5529 So, shouldnÂ’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we goÂ…",
      "snooping around her crotch?\n",
      "5530 Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?\n",
      "5531  Hi!\n",
      "5532 How come?\n",
      "5533 To see her pants?\n",
      "5534 Are you sure? Did you see the stain?\n",
      "5535 God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?\n",
      "5536 Oh dear God!\n",
      "5537 And yet you donÂ’t recognize that youÂ’re crazy.\n",
      "5538 HereÂ’s another planÂ…",
      "No!\n",
      "5539 Why?\n",
      "5540 I fear a jury will see it the same way!\n",
      "5541 You see that?\n",
      "5542 All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if itÂ’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!\n",
      "5543 You need new clothes.\n",
      "5544 IÂ’m leaning. This is where I lean.\n",
      "5545 Brenda a bee!\n",
      "5546 Yes! ItÂ’s flown into your blouse and youÂ’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!\n",
      "5547 You do?\n",
      "5548 I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?\n",
      "5549 Her what?!!\n",
      "5550 You had a bachelorette party?!\n",
      "5551 I thought we werenÂ’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! YÂ’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.\n",
      "5552 You went home with the waitress.\n",
      "5553 I canÂ’t believe you didnÂ’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!\n",
      "5554 My God! You must be good in bed!\n",
      "5555 SheÂ’s okay with Rachel and the baby?\n",
      "5556 Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youÂ’re going down the same path, but youÂ’re really going down different ones.\n",
      "5557 What?\n",
      "5558 Honey! ThatÂ’s crazy! I donÂ’t want you to get me a stripper\n",
      "5559 Look, I appreciate it, but uh, itÂ’s a little creepy. YÂ’know? IÂ’m not a bachelor anymore.\n",
      "5560 All right fine! But IÂ’m only doing this for you!\n",
      "5561 And Joey.\n",
      "5562 Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.\n",
      "5563 I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?\n",
      "5564 What are you doing?\n",
      "5565 Okay. I canÂ’t believe tomorrowÂ’s the big day.\n",
      "5566 YouÂ’re right, this is more fun.\n",
      "5567 Hi. \n",
      "5568 ThatÂ’s me.\n",
      "5569 Yeah, yeah right over there.\n",
      "5570 That was weird.\n",
      "5571 So sheÂ’s a\n",
      "5572 I canÂ’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!\n",
      "5573 Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  MaÂ’am, are you also a stripper?\n",
      "5574 That is funny, maybe for my birthday sheÂ’ll murder someone.\n",
      "5575 Oh actually, IÂ’d rather youÂ…",
      "Yeah, go ahead. WeÂ’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.\n",
      "5576 Why would she do that?\n",
      "5577 This is the worst bachelor party ever!\n",
      "5578  In a minute? WhatÂ’s gonna happen in a minute?!\n",
      "5579 Why me?!\n",
      "5580 Which is why you should do it.\n",
      "5581 You do it!\n",
      "5582 All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?\n",
      "5583 I donÂ’t think weÂ’ve actually done this before!\n",
      "5584 Well weÂ…",
      "we still hang out.\n",
      "5585 Well yÂ’know, things are different. IÂ’mÂ…",
      "IÂ’m married now.\n",
      "5586 Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on weÂ’ll make time to hang out with each other.\n",
      "5587 Her ass print is still on your grandmotherÂ’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?\n",
      "5588 Monica! Wait!\n",
      "5589  Carry on.\n",
      "5590 Could you not narrate?\n",
      "5591 I have no idea.\n",
      "5592 Yeah! IÂ’m just pretending to watch the game so I donÂ’t have to help out with stuff.\n",
      "5593 Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.\n",
      "5594 Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  ThereÂ’s no Anderson.\n",
      "5595 Oh hey. IÂ’d shake your hand but uh; IÂ’m really into the game. Plus, I think itÂ’d be better for my ego if we didnÂ’t stand right next to each other.\n",
      "5596 IÂ’m watching the game, but IÂ’m not deaf!\n",
      "5597  YÂ’know, itÂ’s been a while since weÂ’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.\n",
      "5598 Oh come on!\n",
      "5599 Good game!\n",
      "5600 Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.\n",
      "5601  Detroit.\n",
      "5602 Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!\n",
      "5603 IÂ’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?\n",
      "5604 Did she look 16?\n",
      "5605 Well, she probably wasnÂ’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!\n",
      "5606 Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.\n",
      "5607 New haircut?  Boots!\n",

      "5612 I have you.\n",
      "5613 Hey-hey.\n",
      "5614 You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. \n",
      "5615  Hey!\n",
      "5616  I donÂ’t think you did a very thorough job!\n",
      "5617  WhatÂ’s wrong?\n",
      "5618 Oh donÂ’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. \n",
      "5619 Now sweetie, I know you donÂ’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has aÂ…",
      "supple leather lining.\n",
      "5620 Why not?\n",
      "5621 Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?\n",
      "5622 You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!\n",
      "5623 Okay.\n",
      "5624 YÂ’know, that party wasnÂ’t bad.\n",
      "5625 I donÂ’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?\n",
      "5626 What honey, itÂ’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. LetÂ’s go.\n",
      "5627 WhatÂ’s going on?\n",
      "5628 What?\n",
      "5629 So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  ItÂ’s oddly unsettling.\n",
      "5630 Hop on.\n",
      "5631 Honey, I know youÂ’re in pain right now, but IÂ’m a little turned on.\n",
      "5632 Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.\n",
      "5633 Oh IÂ’m sorry! Do you need a break?\n",
      "5634 I can see it from right here. ItÂ’ll cost you one husband.\n",
      "5635  I donÂ’t have your boots.\n",
      "5636 Well, why donÂ’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!\n",
      "5637 Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?\n",
      "5638 YÂ’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.\n",
      "5639 Okay. \n",
      "5640 Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?\n",
      "5641 I didnÂ’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, IÂ’m sorry.\n",
      "5642 No.\n",
      "5643 Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnÂ’t it?\n",
      "5644 Oh uh, as it turns out, we canÂ’t do it. Monica has to work.\n",
      "5645 Oh uh well tomorrowÂ’s no good for her either.\n",
      "5646 ItÂ’s the semi-finalsÂ…",
      "of herÂ…",
      "botchy ball tournament.\n",
      "5647 Well now-now youÂ’re just talking crazy.\n",
      "5648 Because uh... we-we... we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me\n",
      "5649 Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?\n",
      "5650 Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.\n",
      "5651 Oh thatÂ’s all right sir, and thatÂ’s just one girl.\n",
      "5652 Oh no-no-no!\n",
      "5653 Hi honey IÂ’m home.\n",
      "5654 It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnÂ’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!\n",
      "5655 YÂ’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like ItÂ’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.\n",
      "5656 Ooh, I donÂ’t know if weÂ’re there yet.\n",
      "5657 Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?\n",
      "5658 Oh, okay.\n",
      "5659 I kinda like it here.\n",
      "5660 Well what did it do?\n",
      "5661 A vending machine?\n",
      "5662 Who cares? ItÂ’s a stupid game.\n",
      "5663 I donÂ’t suck. ItÂ’s sucks. You suck.\n",
      "5664 Why do you want to play this game so bad?\n",
      "5665 You are not going to believe what I did today!\n",
      "5666 Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! \n",
      "5667 Well IÂ’ve been playing it for like eight hours, itÂ’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyÂ’re dirty words.\n",
      "5668 Because itÂ’s awesome.\n",
      "5669 Well yÂ’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.\n",
      "5670 It is when you put it together with that one.\n",
      "5671 Come on, he wonÂ’t even know what they mean.\n",
      "5672 Have you talked to him lately?\n",
      "5673 No-no-no, if you unplug it, IÂ’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  Chip in it or something!\n",
      "5674 With the claw?!\n",
      "5675 I did.  But it came at a price.\n",
      "5676 Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!\n",
      "5677 One more score to go! You can do it! \n",
      "5678 All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!\n",
      "5679 Are you, are you high?\n",
      "5680 Really? I donÂ’t like baths.\n",
      "5681 Honey, itÂ’s not the bath I enjoy, itÂ’s the wet, naked lady.\n",
      "5682 Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.\n",
      "5683 Honey, itÂ’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and IÂ’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?\n",
      "5684 Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?\n",

      "5751 Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?\n",
      "5752 Well, itÂ’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? YÂ’know? YouÂ’re doing nothing wrong.  Richard? If-if youÂ’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?\n",
      "5753 Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfÂ…",

      "5776 90 seconds.\n",
      "5777 You know, it haunts me? Up Â‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!\n",
      "5778 I can do that.\n",
      "5779 Okay. Now all weÂ’ve got to do is get rid of this chair. \n",

      "5781 Poor Ross. \n",
      "5782 Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!\n",
      "5783 Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: donÂ’t watch it.\n",
      "5784 Well, letÂ’s just say itÂ’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.\n",

      "5786 Why have I seen this thing three times?!\n",
      "5787 Wait, you guys, look!\n",

      "5792 I think thatÂ’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.\n",
      "5793 Oh hey!\n",
      "5794 No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I donÂ’t think they exist.\n",
      "5795 Why?\n",
      "5796 What?\n",

      "5808  Are you listening to this?\n",
      "5809 What do we do?\n",
      "5810 Sure, why donÂ’t you set it up. IÂ’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.\n",
      "5811 Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.\n",
      "5812 IÂ’m sorry, did you say cheese?\n",
      "5813 Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I donÂ’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wonÂ’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.\n",
      "5814 No. But IÂ’m sure  Â‘tomatoesÂ’ does.\n",
      "5815 You donÂ’t?\n",
      "5816 So youÂ…",

      "5817 I love you.\n",
      "5818 YÂ’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.\n",
      "5819 Hey!\n",
      "5820 I donÂ’t see him.  Do you see him?\n",
      "5821 What?! No! No!\n",
      "5822  I donÂ’t know what thatÂ’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \"I love you,\" was, \"Oh crap!\"\n",
      "5823  We didnÂ’t play it!!\n",
      "5824 I didnÂ’t know you read tea leaves.\n",
      "5825 What does yours say Pheebs?\n",
      "5826 Well, IÂ’m sure you get another one at Ann TaylorÂ’s.\n",
      "5827 Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?\n",
      "5828 I know itÂ’s tough now, but things will get better.\n",
      "5829 IÂ’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?\n",
      "5830 LetÂ’s just say if I canÂ’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.\n",
      "5831 In the James Taylor case.\n",
      "5832 Honey, IÂ’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.\n",
      "5833 Well, if weÂ’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. YÂ’know alphabetically or by genre?\n",

      "6015 I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnÂ’t for fun.\n",
      "6016  Look, I just donÂ’t want you to think that weÂ’re animals who do it whenever we want.\n",
      "6017 ThatÂ’s funny, this conversationÂ’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.\n",
      "6018 Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.\n",
      "6019 You still havenÂ’t told Rachel you werenÂ’t really proposing?\n",

      "6045 But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ainÂ’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, hereÂ’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wonÂ’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is ItalyÂ—Please donÂ’t make me go there!\n",

      "6142 But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesno big deal.\n",
      "6143 Leave it.\n",
      "6144 You tricked me to get me into bed?\n",
      "6145 I feel so used.\n",
      "6146 I would never lie to get someone into bed.\n",
      "6147 I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative shrew.\n",
      "6148 You mean the lully story?\n",
      "6149 Oh yeah, thats what she says. But maybe youre not ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed.\n",
      "6150  You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.\n",
      "6151 Whats the matter with me? Why Im such a girl?\n",
      "6152 So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?\n",

      "6157 \n",
      "6158 Hey!\n",
      "6159 So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.\n",
      "6160  And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.\n",
      "6161 What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?\n",
      "6162 Yeah, he came up...\n",
      "6163  Were you there?\n",
      "6164 Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.\n",
      "6165  Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.\n",
      "6166 Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.\n",
      "6167 Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?\n",
      "6168 Yeah!\n",
      "6169 Ye.... \n",
      "6170 Hey!\n",
      "6171 What are you guys talking about?\n",
      "6172 You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? \n",
      "6173 You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. \n",
      "6174 If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. \n",
      "6175 What is so funny about that? \n",
      "6176 Did you tell her what we talked about? \n",
      "6177 So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? \n",
      "6178 Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?\n",
      "6179 I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.\n",
      "6180 Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.\n",
      "6181 Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!\n",
      "6182 I love you too. \n",
      "6183 See ya! \n",
      "6184 Hi!\n",
      "6185 How come?\n",
      "6186 Do you have any ideas?\n",
      "6187  Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!\n",
      "6188 Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.\n",
      "6189 So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?\n",
      "6190 mmm That's enough about you!\n",
      "6191 No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.\n",
      "6192 We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! \n",
      "6193  Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!\n",
      "6194 There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.\n",
      "6195 Get there faster! \n",
      "6196 I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? \n",
      "6197 Don't judge me, I'm only human!\n",
      "6198 I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?\n",
      "6199 Some girl...!?\n",
      "6200 Yeah...!?\n",
      "6201 Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?\n",
      "6202 Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.\n",
      "6203 Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?\n",
      "6204 Why am I hearing cheering?\n",
      "6205 Football? Just football?\n",
      "6206 It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What are you doing?\n",
      "6207 Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!\n",
      "6208 Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.\n",
      "6209 This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.\n",
      "6210 Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!\n",
      "6211 Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...\n",
      "6212 Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.\n",
      "6213 What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!\n",
      "6214 Is that a problem?\n",
      "6215 Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?\n",
      "6216 Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.\n",
      "6217 What is the point of having them if we never use them?\n",
      "6218 I will explain it to her.\n",
      "6219 Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo! TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .\n",
      "6220 Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?\n",
      "6221 What are you going to do?\n",
      "6222 Well you proved them wrong.\n",
      "6223 I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..\n",
      "6224 Why?\n",
      "6225 Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? < Phoebe comes in>\n",
      "6226 I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.\n",
      "6227 You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>\n",
      "6228 No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?\n",
      "6229 Actually what?\n",
      "6230 What?\n",
      "6231 So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?\n",
      "6232 Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!\n",
      "6233 Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?\n",
      "6234 Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table> she'd have to give her up.\n",
      "6235 So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?\n",
      "6236 Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?\n",
      "6237 Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.\n",
      "6238 Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.\n",
      "6239 Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You're grounded\"?\n",
      "6240 You said that to me last week.\n",
      "6241 Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.\n",
      "6242 Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.\n",
      "6243 Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.\n",
      "6244 By the way, that fight was totally arousing.\n",
      "6245 Oh yeah? Well thanks.\n",
      "6246 Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.\n",
      "6247 Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.\n",
      "6248 Nope...\n",
      "6249 Yep...\n",
      "6250 Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.\n",
      "6251 Maybe not even then. \n",
      "6252  Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.\n",
      "6253 Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.\n",
      "6254 So, who does?\n",
      "6255 I'm sorry, I won't be here.\n",
      "6256 Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day.\n",
      "6257 Did I not mention that?\n",
      "6258 \n",
      "6259 All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.\n",
      "6260 Hey. Where've you been?\n",
      "6261  You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.\n",
      "6262 Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.\n",
      "6263 Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!\n",
      "6264 I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.\n",
      "6265 Haha, no thanks!\n",
      "6266 Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.\n",
      "6267 Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...\n",
      "6268 I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.\n",
      "6269 What? That's terrible!\n",
      "6270 Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.\n",
      "6271 No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!\n",
      "6272 No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.\n",
      "6273 Why?\n",
      "6274 No, I have a great idea for a present for her.\n",
      "6275 If I help, we can find 'em faster!\n",
      "6276 OK, Pheebs, your turn.\n",
      "6277 And, a lemon lime.\n",
      "6278 And last but not least.\n",
      "6279  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!\n",
      "6280 Hey! \n",
      "6281 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?\n",
      "6282 What?\n",
      "6283 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!\n",
      "6284 Why?\n",
      "6285 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.\n",
      "6286 Fine, I'll give the suit back.\n",
      "6287 Santa? Really?\n",
      "6288 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?\n",
      "6289 Then it's okaaay! \n",
      "6290 You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.\n",
      "6291 Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.\n",
      "6292 Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go?\n",
      "6293 Ah. Thanks.\n",
      "6294 Ah.  Chandler Bing.\n",
      "6295 Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!\n",
      "6296 Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.\n",
      "6297 It is. Did I... not tell you about her?\n",
      "6298 I sent them home.\n",
      "6299 Uhh, uh...\n",
      "6300 I don't know!\n",

      "6302 Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.\n",
      "6303 BE-LOW me!\n",
      "6304 Well, she... she didn't win...\n",
      "6305 Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...\n",
      "6306 Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.\n",
      "6307 I'm serious!\n",
      "6308 Merry Christmas.\n",
      "6309 Merry Christmas, you guys!\n",
      "6310  The wife says \"Hi!\".\n",
      "6311 Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.\n",
      "6312 This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.\n",
      "6313 Whoa-ho, back off, Missy! \n",
      "6314 I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?\n",
      "6315  Look, I'm, I'm married!\n",
      "6316 I'm *happily* married.\n",
      "6317 Right. So, I'm sorry...\n",
      "6318 Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.\n",
      "6319 I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!\n",
      "6320 You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\n",
      "6321 But we don't do that.\n",
      "6322 How drunk are you?\n",
      "6323  That's the perfect amount!\n",
      "6324 What?\n",
      "6325 I know.\n",
      "6326 Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?\n",
      "6327 Okay!\n",
      "6328 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.\n",
      "6329 Yep!\n",
      "6330 Count of three?\n",
      "6331 Two!\n",
      "6332 Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.\n",
      "6333 Eh! \n",
      "6334 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?\n",
      "6335 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.\n",
      "6336 Really? Okay, so...\n",
      "6337 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?\n",
      "6338 Right!\n",
      "6339 Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.\n",
      "6340 Let's go! \n",
      "6341 Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.\n",
      "6342 I don't think so.\n",
      "6343 \n",
      "6344 No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.\n",
      "6345 Okay, one thing at a time. \n",
      "6346 Ehh.\n",
      "6347 Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.\n",
      "6348 Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.\n",
      "6349 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.\n",
      "6350 Yeah.\n",
      "6351 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.\n",
      "6352 Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.\n",
      "6353 Sure you do.\n",
      "6354 You sure?\n",
      "6355 I love you so much.\n",
      "6356 Hey!\n",
      "6357 I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.\n",
      "6358 Monica.\n",
      "6359 I never want to leave you again!\n",
      "6360 Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.\n",
      "6361 Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?\n",
      "6362  I have *not* thought this through!\n",
      "6363 I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.\n",
      "6364 Thanks!\n",
      "6365  Ahh...\n",
      "6366 \n",
      "6367 I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.\n",
      "6368 I don't have a *job*!\n",
      "6369 Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...  Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!\n",
      "6370 Hey\n",
      "6371 Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.\n",
      "6372 I tried, but apparantly singing \"I will survive\" in a helium voice - not helping.\n",
      "6373 Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.\n",
      "6374 Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.\n",
      "6375 Now that Rachel's gone?\n",
      "6376 I wasn't staring. I was leering.\n",
      "6377 Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.\n",
      "6378 Seriously dude, 3 years ago.\n",
      "6379 You don't trust him?\n",
      "6380 Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.\n",
      "6381 Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.\n",
      "6382 Picturing that tree?\n",
      "6383 Where you going, Joe?\n",
      "6384 Oh. You mind if I join you?\n",
      "6385 Your thoughts? Plural?\n",
      "6386 I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.\n",
      "6387 Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.\n",
      "6388 Great novels?\n",
      "6389  I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.\n",
      "6390 \n",
      "6391 \n",
      "6392  Hi\n",
      "6393 Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?\n",
      "6394 Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.\n",
      "6395 See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.\n",
      "6396 Wow.\n",
      "6397 Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!\n",
      "6398 Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.\n",
      "6399 Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.\n",
      "6400 No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!\n",
      "6401 I don't do that.\n",
      "6402 I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?\n",
      "6403 Today is the sixth.\n",
      "6404 Yes, it's also 2003.\n",
      "6405 It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.\n",
      "6406 Tough crib.\n",
      "6407 I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.\n",
      "6408 I am not working. There's not much to do around here!\n",
      "6409 Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.\n",
      "6410 I - I don't think I can.\n",
      "6411 Because of Emma.\n",
      "6412 Sorry.\n",
      "6413 Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.\n",
      "6414 Well, I can't say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front of the B-A-B-Y.\n",
      "6415 Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?\n",
      "6416 You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.\n",
      "6417 Emma was doing it!\n",
      "6418 Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...\n",
      "6419 Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.\n",
      "6420 I think we may have really done it this time.\n",
      "6421 You may wanna get some more of those too.\n",
      "6422 Where's Emma?\n",
      "6423 Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!\n",
      "6424 Okay. \n",
      "6425 All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.\n",
      "6426 No, no, no.\n",
      "6427 What? Why?\n",
      "6428 Your family name is Tribbiani.\n",
      "6429 Thank you. I got a job in advertising. \n",

      "6432 Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.\n",
      "6433 Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating\n",

This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.\n",

      "6565 He's the boss's son.\n",
      "6566 What about the ones you have on the nightstand?\n",
      "6567 Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.\n",
      "6568 Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!\n",
      "6569  She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...\n",
      "6570 Let me finish ... \n",
      "6571 Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!\n",
      "6572 Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...\n",
      "6573  Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!\n",
      "6574 Ok, here we go! \n",
      "6575 This is..shhh!\n",
      "6576 Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?\n",
      "6577 Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?\n",
      "6578 I got that!\n",
      "6579 No.\n",
      "6580 Ah, the \"I'm sorry I rejected you\" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve.\n",
      "6581 Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!\n",
      "6582 Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?\n",
      "6583 Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .\n",
      "6584 What?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.\n",
      "6585 Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?\n",
      "6586 Thanks, man.\n",
      "6587 Really? What?\n",
      "6588  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.\n",
      "6589 Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.\n",
      "6590 Me too.\n",
      "6591  Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!\n",
      "6592 What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !\n",
      "6593 So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?\n",
      "6594 Are you really that busy?\n",
      "6595 Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule.  Oh, can't you make an exception?\"\n",
      "6596  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...\n",
      "6597 I don't have travel insurance.\n",
      "6598 Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.\n",
      "6599 New York.\n",
      "6600 I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.\n",
      "6601 Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?\n",
      "6602 Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?\n",
      "6603 Just give us the cheapest room you have.\n",
      "6604 That's insane!\n",
      "6605 Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.\n",
      "6606  What!? They are totally ripping us off!\n",
      "6607 Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!\n",
      "6608 Dude, you're shaking!\n",
      "6609 USA Today\n",
      "6610 And I also got... two more apples.\n",
      "6611 I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.\n",
      "6612 I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.\n",
      "6613 Ok, how about this ?\n",
      "6614 Yes, but the batteries...\n",
      "6615 Thank you, thank you very much!\n",
      "6616 No!\n",
      "6617 Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\n",
      "6618 Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\n",
      "6619 What?\n",
      "6620 Look, we have enough, just walk away.\n",
      "6621 There's a forest right outside.\n",
      "6622 Ok, go quick!\n",
      "6623 I got you something from Vermont! \n",
      "6624  Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.\n",
      "6625 I could fall asleep at a play.\n",
      "6626  Uh, let's see, who do I hate?\n",
      "6627 Hey!\n",
      "6628 Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.\n",
      "6629  No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.\n",
      "6630 Where the hell is everybody?\n",
      "6631  oh yes, God yes!!\n",
      "6632 I... I don't know... you seem lovely.\n",
      "6633  So, how did you enjoy the play?\n",
      "6634 Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.\n",
      "6635 Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  But after chapter 16: \"fat, single and ready to mingle\", I was uplifted.\n",
      "6636 Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!\n",
      "6637 Did somebody sign your bra?\n",
      "6638 Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.\n",
      "6639 Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .\n",
      "6640 I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?\n",
      "6641  So, a professor, uh?\n",
      "6642 Oh, yeah?\n",
      "6643 Oh, well... Maybe we could... \n",
      "6644 We really need to take those tests?\n",
      "6645 But I don't wanna do it in a cup!\n",
      "6646 It's weird! In a doctor's office?\n",
      "6647  And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!\n",
      "6648 Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!\n",
      "6649 Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!\n",
      "6650 I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.\n",
      "6651 Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.\n",
      "6652 Yeah, I guess!\n",
      "6653 Oh, Come on!\n",
      "6654 Why are you here?\n",
      "6655  No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??\n",
      "6656 What!?\n",
      "6657 I'd love to stay, but I have eh... \n",
      "6658 \n",
      "6659  Janice! You're not... gone?\n",
      "6660 Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!\n",
      "6661 I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.\n",
      "6662  Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?\n",
      "6663  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...\n",
      "6664  It was a \"Wendy's!! \"\n",
      "6665  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.\n",
      "6666 Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. \n",
      "6667 Doctor Connelly just called.\n",
      "6668 Actually it's both of us.\n",
      "6669 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.\n",
      "6670 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...\n",
      "6671  It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.\n",
      "6672 I'm sorry.\n",
      "6673 Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.\n",
      "6674  Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!\n",
      "6675 Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!\n",
      "6676 Hi.\n",
      "6677 Oh, DAMN IT!\n",
      "6678 Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!\n",
      "6679  Hey guys!\n",
      "6680 I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.\n",
      "6681 But you come first!\n",
      "6682  Ok.\n",
      "6683 Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.\n",
      "6684 Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.\n",
      "6685 Yeah.\n",
      "6686 Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.\n",
      "6687  ah-ha!\n",
      "6688 I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.\n",
      "6689 Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!\n",
      "6690 You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.\n",
      "6691  So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?\n",
      "6692 So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!\n",
      "6693 Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!\n",
      "6694 No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.\n",
      "6695 I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!\n",
      "6696 Ok!\n",
      "6697  Zack!\n",
      "6698 So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!\n",
      "6699 You don't like him.\n",
      "6700 Alright! Just follow my lead!\n",
      "6701 Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?\n",
      "6702  That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.\n",
      "6703 You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness \n",
      "6704 I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?\n",
      "6705  We're teeth people Zack!\n",
      "6706 You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?\n",
      "6707 Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.\n",
      "6708 Ok.\n",
      "6709 I think we've found our sperm!\n",
      "6710 Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?\n",
      "6711 Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!\n",
      "6712 Yeah, he's better!\n",
      "6713 Really? Are you sure?\n",
      "6714  Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.\n",
      "6715 So you know this leaves us with...\n",
      "6716 How do you feel about that?\n",
      "6717 Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.\n",
      "6718  Yeah.\n",
      "6719 We are gonna be great parents.\n",
      "6720 Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!\n",
      "6721 Hey, Zack!\n",
      "6722 Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "6723 Really?\n",
      "6724 My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.\n",
      "6725 You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?\n",
      "6726 Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, \"island's stuff\".\n",
      "6727 Yeah, that's the same as \"it has something to do with wind\".\n",
      "6728  She does?\n",
      "6729 I wouldn't read too much into it.\n",
      "6730 David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.\n",
      "6731 Seriously, we're gonna do this?\n",
      "6732 Oh, because his penis was too big.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?\n",
      "6733 What?\n",
      "6734 I didn't mean now...\n",
      "6735 Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.\n",
      "6736 David, I'm pretending to read here!!\n",
      "6737  \"I do\".\n",
      "6738 David is going to propose to Phoebe.\n",
      "6739 Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.\n",
      "6740 I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?\n",
      "6741 Man, that's some bad advice!\n",
      "6742 That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!\n",
      "6743 Tonight?!  Oh, there it is!\n",
      "6744 \n",
      "6745 Monica, can I talk to you for a sec? \n",
      "6746 David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!\n",
      "6747 That would be advice!!\n",
      "6748 Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?\n",
      "6749  May I?\n",
      "6750  Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!\n",
      "6751 Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!\n",
      "6752 It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.\n",
      "6753 Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.\n",
      "6754 Well, it didn't say \"This is a virus\"!!\n",
      "6755 Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.\n",
      "6756 It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?\n",
      "6757 Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!\n",
      "6758 I just feel awful.\n",
      "6759 Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... \n",
      "6760  Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!\n",
      "6761 Phoebe is going to say \"yes\"? That's, that's great!\n",
      "6762 And there's not chance that will work?\n",
      "6763  Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!\n",
      "6764 This vacation sucks!!\n",
      "6765 You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.\n",
      "6766 I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  \"Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh...\" Spit it out, David!\n",
      "6767 I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.\n",
      "6768 Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.\n",
      "6769 I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!\n",
      "6770 Hey! Remember when I had corneas?\n",
      "6771 Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.\n",
      "6772  Not to mention the cold sores.\n",
      "6773  Really?\n",
      "6774 I don't think so!\n",
      "6775 Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!\n",
      "6776 Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?\n",
      "6777 And...?\n",
      "6778 I'm not playing with you.\n",
      "6779 She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!\n",
      "6780  Oh dear God, there's two of them!\n",
      "6781  Did you know this about him?\n",
      "6782  OK!\n",
      "6783 Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!\n",
      "6784  Do you really find this attractive on him?\n",
      "6785 I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.\n",
      "6786 Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.\n",
      "6787 Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?\n",
      "6788  Ok, look! Enough is enough!\n",
      "6789 Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!\n",
      "6790 But...\n",
      "6791 What about the obsessive cleaning?\n",
      "6792 You ok?\n",
      "6793 No, you didn't.\n",
      "6794 Because I'm gonna play for ya.\n",
      "6795  Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.\n",
      "6796  You're welcome, sweetheart.\n",
      "6797 All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.\n",
      "6798 And that's... how... it's done!\n",
      "6799 I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!\n",
      "6800 I don't know.\n",
      "6801 That's why!\n",
      "6802 You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.\n",
      "6803 You're on!\n",
      "6804 He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.\n",
      "6805 She's cheating on Joey with Ross!\n",
      "6806 Wow!\n",
      "6807 How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!\n",
      "6808 Anything?\n",
      "6809 You do realise that's your brother?\n",
      "6810 That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.\n",
      "6811 Okay Buckwheat!\n",
      "6812 And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!\n",
      "6813  Bye!\n",
      "6814 He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... \n",
      "6815 You got it!\n",
      "6816 Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?\n",
      "6817 Enunciate!\n",
      "6818 Hey!\n",
      "6819 Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.\n",
      "6820 You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?\n",
      "6821 Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!\n",
      "6822 I think.... I think I can see your scalp.\n",
      "6823 What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.\n",
      "6824 Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.\n",
      "6825 Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.\n",
      "6826 You go back to work tomorrow night, right?\n",
      "6827 So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?\n",
      "6828 What are you singing?\n",
      "6829 It's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse Now\"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!\n",
      "6830 Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.\n",
      "6831 Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.\n",
      "6832 Hit yourself in the tooth?\n",
      "6833 Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?\n",
      "6834 Really? What happened?\n",
      "6835 You can't move at all?\n",
      "6836 If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?\n",
      "6837  Some of these look a little frayed.\n",
      "6838 Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?\n",
      "6839 I think you know.\n",
      "6840 This is what I want to do.\n",
      "6841  She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.\n",
      "6842 There's a hair in my coffee.\n",
      "6843 You know, it's funny. Every time you say \"triplets,\" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.\n",
      "6844 So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?\n",
      "6845 I mean, you have a lovely home.\n",
      "6846 That's great.  Can I see the book?\n",
      "6847 You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?\n",
      "6848 Hey, you must be Owen.\n",
      "6849 I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.\n",
      "6850 Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.\n",
      "6851 You know how to use a compass?\n",
      "6852 You do? That's fantastic!\n",
      "6853 I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.\n",
      "6854 What?\n",
      "6855 I got nothing.\n",
      "6856 Where are Bill and Colleen?\n",
      "6857 We have to leave!!\n",
      "6858 I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.\n",
      "6859 But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?\n",
      "6860 See? Intuitive!\n",
      "6861 Which technically now you should give back!\n",
      "6862 I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. \"Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.\"\n",
      "6863 Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.\n",
      "6864 Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?\n",
      "6865 I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. \n",
      "6866 So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?\n",
      "6867 Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?\n",
      "6868 What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.\n",
      "6869 How can you be so confident?\n",
      "6870 Really? Like you have a routine?\n",
      "6871 Really?\n",
      "6872 You mean like this? \n",
      "6873 Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. \n",
      "6874 ...and beer!!\n",
      "6875 Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!\n",
      "6876 She went on one of those spray-on tan places.\n",
      "6877  Why...why?\n",
      "6878 Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.\n",
      "6879 Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "6880 Who's Amanda?\n",
      "6881 Are you trying to do a British accent?\n",
      "6882 Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?\n",
      "6883 No, had it done to me though. Feels good !\n",
      "6884 Hello? Is someone on the line?\n",
      "6885 Hang on, sheâ€™s right here.  Someone's on the phone, for ya.\n",
      "6886  I get pedicures!\n",
      "6887 Hold on! There is something different.\n",
      "6888 Was that place... The Sun?\n",
      "6889 Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!\n",
      "6890 How was your date with Joey?\n",
      "6891 You didn't like that?\n",
      "6892 If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!\n",
      "6893 Well, aren't you a treat.\n",
      "6894 That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!\n",
      "6895 Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...\n",
      "6896 Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.\n",
      "6897 I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.\n",
      "6898 Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.\n",
      "6899 I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.\n",
      "6900 No, I just had to get a picture of this.\n",
      "6901 I see you later!\n",
      "6902 Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.\n",
      "6903 Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!\n",
      "6904 There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...\n",
      "6905 Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...\n",
      "6906 Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?\n",
      "6907 Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.\n",
      "6908 I know, what are we gonna do?\n",
      "6909 I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!\n",
      "6910 To be fair this one does have nuts.\n",
      "6911 Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?\n",
      "6912 We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. \n",
      "6913 Was that Emma? Is she up?\n",
      "6914 I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!\n",
      "6915 To the bathroom!\n",
      "6916 \n",
      "6917 You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?\n",
      "6918 I'm begging you stop.\n",
      "6919  That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!\n",
      "6920 Thats a bear.\n",
      "6921 Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!\n",
      "6922 I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?\n",
      "6923 They left.\n",
      "6924 I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?\n",
      "6925 Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.\n",
      "6926 Ooh! That's my girl!\n",
      "6927 Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?\n",
      "6928 Me too...\n",
      "6929 There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?\n",
      "6930 I was kidding.\n",
      "6931 No, not yet.\n",
      "6932 Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.\n",
      "6933 Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? \n",
      "6934 Let's do it, come on!\n",
      "6935 Thanks!\n",
      "6936 Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.\n",
      "6937 So excited about your letter!\n",
      "6938 So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?\n",
      "6939 That's where people make number two!!\n",
      "6940  I donâ€™t... uh... understand.\n",
      "6941 On every word?\n",
      "6942 And that became â€˜they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?\n",
      "6943 You know what? You donâ€™t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.\n",
      "6944 I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.\n",
      "6945 Word!\n",
      "6946 She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?\n",
      "6947 Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!\n",
      "6948 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?\n",
      "6949 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?\n",
      "6950 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?\n",
      "6951 It's ok, it's ok. You know what? \n",
      "6952 .\n",
      "6953  They loved it.\n",
      "6954 They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.\n",
      "6955 She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.\n",
      "6956 That sounds like fun.\n",
      "6957 I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!\n",
      "6958 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?\n",
      "6959 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!\n",
      "6960 Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.\n",
      "6961  Hey honey!\n",
      "6962 Is Monica not here?\n",
      "6963 Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!\n",
      "6964 Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!\n",
      "6965 Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.\n",
      "6966 First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.\n",
      "6967 Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?\n",
      "6968 Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.\n",
      "6969 Joe...\n",
      "6970 Fine!\n",
      "6971 Work, Joe!\n",
      "6972 What am I gonna do now?\n",
      "6973 He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!\n",
      "6974 That's good! I liked it, they didn't. .\n",
      "6975 Hey Joe!\n",
      "6976 Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.\n",
      "6977  I'm sorry man.\n",
      "6978  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!\n",
      "6979  What!? Of course I did!\n",
      "6980 I'm not lying to you, I watched it!\n",
      "6981 I watched it!\n",
      "6982  I did!\n",
      "6983 \n",
      "6984  No!\n",
      "6985 I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!\n",
      "6986 What did I just say?\n",
      "6987 Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...\n",
      "6988 Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?\n",
      "6989 He really is a chameleon.\n",
      "6990 Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.\n",
      "6991 I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?\n",
      "6992 Lying is wrong!\n",
      "6993 I'm a pretty little girl.\n",
      "6994 That's funny, we were doing the same thing!\n",
      "6995 Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.\n",
      "6996 It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.\n",
      "6997  Maybe you do that next time you get married!\n",
      "6998 Hey!\n",
      "6999 Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.\n",
      "7000 You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!\n",
      "7001 Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.\n",
      "7002  Little people?\n",
      "7003 What...? NO!\n",
      "7004  I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!\n",
      "7005 I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.\n",
      "7006 Ok, ok, here we go.\n",
      "7007 Here we go. Stand up straight. \n",
      "7008 But you already gave all your money to charity!\n",
      "7009 I donâ€™t think you can do that!\n",
      "7010 Thatâ€™s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.\n",
      "7011 Oh, because we love kids. Love â€˜em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.\n",
      "7012 But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.\n",
      "7013 What?\n",
      "7014 Of course it was!\n",
      "7015 RAT BASTARD!\n",
      "7016 Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.\n",
      "7017  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!\n",
      "7018 Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. \n",
      "7019 WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!\n",
      "7020 Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.\n",
      "7021  You can't make this stuff up!\n",
      "7022 What the hell are you doing?\n",
      "7023 Well, we're not.\n",
      "7024 We don't have a code word.\n",
      "7025 Any room that isn't behind this couch! \n",
      "7026  You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.\n",
      "7027 Ok!\n",
      "7028 What?\n",
      "7029 And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! \n",
      "7030 I can explain... Joey...\n",
      "7031 Oh, that's really ok.\n",
      "7032 Wrong number?\n",
      "7033 That's great!\n",
      "7034 Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?\n",
      "7035 Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.\n",
      "7036 Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.\n",
      "7037 No, no! We made this decision together.\n",
      "7038 Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!\n",
      "7039 We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?\n",
      "7040 Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?\n",
      "7041 You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!\n",
      "7042 Somebody is gonna pick us.\n",
      "7043 I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!\n",
      "7044  \"The Firm\"?\n",
      "7045 You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.\n",
      "7046 I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".\n",
      "7047 Tell me more.\n",
      "7048 You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!\n",
      "7049 Oh my God!\n",
      "7050 Hmm, the game's at one.\n",
      "7051 Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.\n",
      "7052 You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.\n",
      "7053 Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!\n",
      "7054 Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!\n",
      "7055 I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!\n",
      "7056  They're out there!\n",
      "7057  Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!\n",
      "7058  Ross' shirt is torn.\n",
      "7059 Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?\n",
      "7060  Oh thank God!\n",
      "7061  That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.\n",
      "7062 Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. \n",
      "7063 HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!\n",
      "7064 Please let me stay on this side of the door.\n",
      "7065 The cranberries...?\n",
      "7066 He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! \n",
      "7067 The floating heads do make a good point.\n",
      "7068 Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.\n",
      "7069 That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.\n",
      "7070 A little late for that.\n",
      "7071 Uhm, we've got turkey grease.\n",
      "7072 Can you ever feel your ears?\n",
      "7073  Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!\n",
      "7074 Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!\n",
      "7075 Come on guys, PUSH!\n",
      "7076 My cranberries!\n",
      "7077 Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!\n",
      "7078  Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!\n",
      "7079 What's going on?\n",
      "7080 And?\n",
      "7081 Are you serious? \n",
      "7082 That is the exact same thing.\n",
      "7083 Hi!\n",
      "7084 We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.\n",
      "7085 And so incorrect!\n",
      "7086 Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.\n",
      "7087 Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..\n",
      "7088 I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.\n",
      "7089 So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?\n",
      "7090 Yes, but...\n",
      "7091 Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!\n",
      "7092 Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: \"Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?\"\n",
      "7093 You're gonna be great.\n",
      "7094 Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.\n",
      "7095 Ok.\n",
      "7096 That's what our friends call us.\n",
      "7097  I don't think that's exactly...\n",
      "7098 So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wifeâ€™s a reverend, thatâ€™s important to you?\n",
      "7099 Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!\n",
      "7100 Yeah, wow.\n",
      "7101 No-ot for me it doesnâ€™t.\n",
      "7102 Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?\n",
      "7103 You should be. Youâ€™re really on top of stuff..\n",
      "7104 Yeah, I did.\n",
      "7105 We are NOT signing those papers.\n",
      "7106 It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.\n",
      "7107 You have gotta stop!\n",
      "7108 She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.\n",
      "7109 Your Veal Chop is $34,95!\n",
      "7110 But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?\n",
      "7111 I know..\n",
      "7112 oh, honey..\n",
      "7113 Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Monica: \n",
      "7114 So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.\n",
      "7115 You're Jewish.\n",
      "7116 Hey.\n",
      "7117 The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.\n",
      "7118 I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.\n",
      "7119 Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.\n",
      "7120 Erica wait!\n",
      "7121 You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.\n",
      "7122 Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.\n",
      "7123 But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?\n",
      "7124 You still want that baby?\n",
      "7125  Seriously, answer faster!\n",
      "7126  It's like a giant hug.\n",
      "7127  Hello.\n",
      "7128 Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.\n",
      "7129 Those are all really old!\n",
      "7130 Hi!\n",
      "7131 I was in the car with Nancy all day.\n",
      "7132 Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!\n",
      "7133 Itâ€™s perfect. Itâ€™s everything weâ€™ve been looking for.\n",
      "7134 And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?\n",
      "7135 And the fireplace in the bedroom.\n",
      "7136 This is bringing out a lovely color in you!\n",
      "7137 I donâ€™t know. What do you think?\n",

      "7143 Hey!\n",
      "7144 Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?\n",
      "7145 Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.\n",
      "7146 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.\n",

      "7165 Sure!\n",
      "7166 Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",

      "7218  Hmm mmmhm..\n",

      "7249 Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.\n",
      "7250 Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.\n",
      "7251 Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!\n",
      "7252 Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.\n",

      "7259 You told us both we could be in the wedding? \n",
      "7260 Rach, Rach, knock knock.\n",
      "7261 I'll tell you at the wedding.\n",
      "7262 So technically, would this person be in the wedding?\n",
      "7263 I'm not scared.  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.\n",
      "7264  I'll do it.\n",
      "7265  Ah ah...\n",
      "7266  Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?\n",
      "7267 Oh yeah! \n",

      "7269 Okay.\n",
      "7270 Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?\n",
      "7271 You look beautiful.\n",
      "7272 That really was an incredible wedding.\n",
      "7273 I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.\n",
      "7274 I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.\n",
      "7275 So, where's Mike?\n",
      "7276 Hey.\n",
      "7277 Why are you wearing my apron?\n",
      "7278 Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as \"my wife\" and \"the woman who's carrying my child\"?  No? Divorce?\n",
      "7279 Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes \"Mooooo\"!\n",
      "7280 I'm so sorry...\n",
      "7281 Monica. Calm, self.\n",
      "7282 Why would you say that?\n",
      "7283 Great!  This baby'd better to be really good.\n",
      "7284  New York is awesome!\n",
      "7285 Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.\n",
      "7286 Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?\n",
      "7287 That's great.\n",
      "7288 So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?\n",
      "7289 I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.\n",
      "7290 Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! \n",
      "7291 Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.\n",
      "7292 I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.\n",
      "7293 I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?\n",
      "7294 Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!\n",
      "7295 Hey! How was lunch?\n",
      "7296  Oh, really?\n",
      "7297 O-okay.  So, is she gonna take the test?\n",
      "7298 Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?\n",
      "7299 How do you know?\n",
      "7300 Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?\n",
      "7301  Shovely Joe!\n",
      "7302 Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.\n",
      "7303 You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. \n",
      "7304 A dinosaur died a million years ago?\n",
      "7305 YOU NEVER DID IT!\n",
      "7306 Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.\n",
      "7307 Mrs Hannigan?\n",
      "7308 Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?\n",
      "7309 Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.\n",
      "7310 Damn it.\n",
      "7311 That's what we were gonna name the baby.\n",
      "7312 Hey, how'd the interview go?\n",
      "7313 You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.\n",
      "7314 That is a bad interview.\n",
      "7315 Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!\n",
      "7316 To Ross!\n",
      "7317 And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.\n",
      "7318 What?\n",
      "7319 When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?\n",
      "7320 Man, those two dogs are going at it!\n",
      "7321 Hey.\n",
      "7322 Really? What changed your mind?\n",
      "7323 Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.\n",
      "7324 Ha! I'm just messing with you.\n",
      "7325 You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?\n",
      "7326 It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!\n",
      "7327 Excuse me?\n",
      "7328 For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.\n",
      "7329 How did the job stuff go?\n",
      "7330 That's great!\n",
      "7331 How did the job stuff go?\n",
      "7332 Or facing a bitch of a commute.\n",
      "7333 My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. \n",
      "7334 Well, it makes me feel sad, but...\n",
      "7335 I see.\n",
      "7336 Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?\n",
      "7337 We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.\n",
      "7338 What do you think Pheebs?\n",
      "7339 Yeah.\n",
      "7340 You're kidding!\n",
      "7341 Oh yeah?\n",
      "7342 I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.\n",
      "7343 Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.\n",
      "7344 It feels like weâ€™re cheating on our house. And if weâ€™re gonna cheat, shouldnâ€™t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house wonâ€™t do?\n",
      "7345 And yet I never run into Beyonce!\n",
      "7346 \n",
      "7347  Why!?\n",
      "7348 This can not be happening!\n",
      "7349 The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.\n",
      "7350 That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?\n",
      "7351 Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.\n",
      "7352 Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  \"Oh My God\"!\n",
      "7353 \n",
      "7354 The Hitlers will be so disappointed.\n",
      "7355 Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.\n",
      "7356 Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.\n",
      "7357 I never stopped loving you.\n",
      "7358 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.\n",
      "7359 Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.\n",
      "7360  Obviously.\n",
      "7361 Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.\n",
      "7362 I understand.\n",
      "7363  They're never coming down now.\n",
      "7364 Hey!\n",
      "7365 So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.\n",
      "7366 Where's your passport?\n",
      "7367 Well, it's not.\n",
      "7368 We're taking a break!\n",
      "7369 Jumping on the bed?\n",
      "7370 No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.\n",
      "7371  What the hell is this?\n",
      "7372 I didn't know Monica had these!\n",
      "7373 Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!\n",
      "7374 Hey.\n",
      "7375 I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!\n",
      "7376 Yes, Joe?\n",
      "7377 Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!\n",
      "7378 Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!\n",
      "7379 Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?\n",
      "7380 Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! \n",
      "7381 . Well played.\n",
      "7382 Uh, Rach?\n",
      "7383 \n",
      "7384 No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.\n",
      "7385 Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?\n",
      "7386 Pheebs!\n",
      "7387 I think these are yours.\n",
      "7388 Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?\n",
      "7389 Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.\n",
      "7390 Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.\n",
      "7391 I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.\n",
      "7392 Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.\n",
      "7393 That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.\n",
      "7394 Mine was a humdinger\n",
      "7395 Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.\n",
      "7396 Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.\n",
      "7397 \n",
      "7398 Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.\n",
      "7399 Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.\n",
      "7400 Monica's grandmother.\n",
      "7401 Relax! We just get her some antacids.\n",
      "7402 Oh my God!\n",
      "7403 Honey, it's gonna be okay.\n",
      "7404 What?\n",
      "7405 Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.\n",
      "7406 Oh my God!\n",
      "7407 Next time, can I say breathe?\n",
      "7408 Where are you going?\n",
      "7409 You can't leave me alone with her.\n",
      "7410 This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!\n",
      "7411 It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.\n",
      "7412 Okay.\n",
      "7413 So, ah... Any plans for the summer?\n",
      "7414 Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?\n",
      "7415 Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.\n",
      "7416 One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.\n",
      "7417 Is it really that bad?\n",
      "7418 I'm okay.\n",
      "7419 Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.\n",
      "7420 Wow!\n",
      "7421  It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.\n",
      "7422 Well, that's spongy.\n",
      "7423 I know. He has your eyes.\n",
      "7424 I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.\n",
      "7425 Okay.\n",
      "7426 How do you feel?\n",
      "7427 Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!\n",
      "7428 Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.\n",
      "7429 Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?\n",
      "7430 What do we do?\n",
      "7431  Twins! Twins!!\n",
      "7432 Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?\n",
      "7433 Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.\n",
      "7434 What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?\n",
      "7435 Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!\n",
      "7436  Okay. Shhh...\n",
      "7437 Okay.\n",
